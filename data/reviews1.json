The walk takes you under the freeway where lots of homeless hang out, so I'm not recommending the walk at night. And the hotel itself -- it's OK. Actually it's quite good. Nice decor, reasonably priced, a bit stinky in the lobby but helpful staff, free shuttle to/from LAX, and the rooms are clean -- except, my buddy who stayed in the room across from me got insect bites all over his leg in the one night we were there.

I woke up at 2am in the morning due to some retarded couple that decided to get in a yelling match.

It would have been nice if the walls were thicker to muffle the noise of rude guests, but what are you going to do? That being said, you can not knock a hotel for the actions of other rude guests.

There is one restaurant in the hotel which i did not eat at as the prices were ridiculous for what you got, considering Mc Donalds was next door for a quarter of the price.What was really dissapointing was our flight back to Australia was 11.30pm the following night, and i asked for a later checkout if possible, they said yes but for 5 extra hours it would be $69.00 plus tax, even though i prepaid the whole night for $104.00.

Moving from the lobby to the guest area was like be transported in a time portal.

I returned at lunch time towel in hand for a quick dip and by that stage things were set up in a more orderly fashion. If the pool is a big seller for you please note the following; the pool is at the side of the building and is surrounded by a large wall, while this allows a fair degree of privacy it also effectively leaves the pool in the shade for most of the day - hence it's freezing cold. More critically access to the pool means leaving and reentering the hotel through the lobby of the hotel itself. Pictures of the pool also exaggerate it's size. In my opinion the pool is there as a box ticker rather than an integral part of the offering, i felt suckered by it and I didn't have grandiose expectations to start with!

We dropped off our luggage and headed down to the hotel resturant which was ok. When we returned to our room, I went to wash my face and discovered there were no washcloths. I also went to use the toliet and noticed that the toliet seat had brown liquid looking stains on the seat. Gross! I called the front desk to tell them that I needed wash cloths and the toliet was disgusting. They sent someone to bring me washcloths but they took off without cleaning the toliet. I called the front desk again about the toliet. 40 minutes later, no one had come to clean the toliet. I called again and finally said forget it, I wiped it myself. I asked to speak with a manager and told her about the nasty toliet, having to wait 40+ minutes for someone who never came. I told her I finally cleaned it because - #1 - I needed to pee and #2 - my husband wanted to take a shower since we had driven 6 hours that day, we were tired and wanted to go to bed. I also told her there was hair on both pillow cases and the pillow cases were either stained or dirty. While I was on the phone with the manager, someone finally showed up. He proceeded to wipe down the toliet with a damp washcloth. My question is, if something looks like fecal matter on the toliet, don't you use a disinfectant or something other than a damp washcloth? It only got worse. The washcloths that were brought to me still looked dirty, as did the hand towels. I informed the manager of this as well. The shower curtain was so beat up it was literally hanging on by a thread. The tub had paint chips, which are sharp by the way. The windows were so incredibly filthy, I could barely see out of them. Most of the parking spots were for compact cars. I watched two cars spend 15 minutes trying to park in the tiny spaces.

The desk agent was very helpful and offered us a very reasonably priced room, which we booked for the evening. We were too tired to really check out the accommodations, but it was a fairly clean and well-appointed room, and the quality was good. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The downside was that we woke up to some sort of alarm - possibly a fire alarm? My friend had woken up before me to what she described as a woman screaming loudly in the hallway and then a man's voice yelling \"hey!!!\" threateningly - it was then, she said, that the alarm started going off. It was still pretty early at this time, and the alarm lasted for long enough that we were unable to get back to sleep. When we went downstairs to see if the concierge could help us map a way to our next destination, we were perturbed to find two uniformed cops in the lobby, perchance connected to the scream and the alarm? The concierge was very helpful and we were able to leave soon after without incident. I would stay again, although not by myself based on that experience.

My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street address and direct to Customer Service VP.

It advertises itself as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recently renovated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the site for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family fun.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I add: not fun without a classic struggle. Overnight travelers, the apparently hardy, and collegiate youth groups and cruise transfers abound: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have five for two rooms, do you have a room with three beds?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just know: check things out carefully when you arrive. COMMENDABLE: Pleasant (but overworked yet commendably calm) front desk staff. Helpful bell staff. Very nice bedding. Fab towels. Outdoor pool and workout room, I did not experience. Did not use restaurant. Good quality comp internet. Frequent airport shuttle, a vendor that stops at Westin and LaQuinta. At busy times, cannot accommodate all those waiting. Next to a McDonalds, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic all day and night. A bus stop right in front, #171 goes up Century to the more westerly hotels. You can get public transit directions on Google Maps. TROUBLING: Very expensive parking. Poorly explained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free 20 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for checkin and out, requiring entry to secured lot and another front desk wait. MY EXPERIENCE OF ONE NIGHT: no bathmat--easily subbed a towel, no wash cloths. Coffee maker standard but not in room; replaced by a coffee maker but no cups or coffee or condiments, solo coffee maker and wash cloths left outside room door. CHAOS noise at 630 AM while room 203 across the hall was noisily vacuumed--a flood? This was not my choice of arising time. I went to front desk in evening to ask for coffee cup not in room so I could make hot water. This errand occupied 12 minutes, mostly waiting. A lot of waiting is waiting to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153helped\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the over-busy front desk. Ditto at checkout. I needed to make a call long distance, no charges listed in room guide.

The purpose of my trip was for 6 adult business partners and clients - all traveling seperately and with no personal relationships to spend a week in Los Angeles to attend and work at a major music event. I made the reservation through Priceline and was guaranteed accommodation for 6 adults, with 3 hotel rooms. Upon arrival in 3 cars, we were stopped at the front gate - which is approx. 1/4 of a mile away from the hotel entrance - by a barrier which required us to push a button to validate each car and would charge us $16 per car, per night for parking. Quickly doing some math at the gate I figured that 3 cars for 7 days at $16 per car was going to cost me an extra $336 + 9.5% tax!! This by itself was a huge shock to me as it was a drastic expense for which I had neither planned, budgeted or been told about. They literally wait until you are at the front gate! Obviously, having just got off a red eye flight, we all just wanted to get to bed. At the desk I spoke to the manager on duty, Rodolfo Guitierez, about the parking. His immediate reaction took all of us by surprise...he stated that we should go and park elsewhere if we're not happy. He then started laughing and joking in Spanish to his staff which made me afraid for my safety as I was in a city I had never visited before. He would even start to address me in Spanish and then convert back to English mid-sentence. Is this the type of point-of-contact customer service that Holiday Inn is training their employees, especially managers? It was very clear that this man was tired, angry and had a very short temper. Any kind of bargaining or simple question was shot down in flames with a very stern \"will that be all senor?\". I am Sir not Senor. At this point, whilst realizing that I'm going to have to fork out for the parking, I just wanted some sleep. This next part just blows my mind. All 6 of us went to our respective 3 reserved rooms and looked on in horror as we discovered that each room only had 1 bed. This is the first time in my entire traveling life that I have booked a room for 2 people where they only give you 1 bed. I immediately thought that there was a mistake, so I went to the front desk again, to speak to the same manager, again. I told him that there are 6 of us so we need 6 beds. He very aggressively told me that each room now only has 1 bed and for a second bed there is a surcharge of $22 per night. Again, calculating 3 extra beds at $22 per night per bed for 7 days, I was looking at an additional $462 + 9.5% tax. This made the situation very distressing, as I had chosen this run down hotel at a cheaper rate with priceline and now realized that for the same price I could have stayed in a 5 star hotel in Hollywood. I tried to reason with the manager and explain my situation but he was clearly in no mood to talk to guests. He has obviously dealt with this same subject with many, many previous guests as he was almost expecting my questions and was basically ignoring them. He told me to call Priceline and move aside to allow other guests to check in. I called Priceline and had quite possibly the longest, most pointless conversation with a middle eastern girl who would not answer any questions. I asked for a supervisor and was told that there are no supervisors. I hung up. I then called Holiday Inn corporate office and spoke to a man who was very nice and told me he would contact the hotel manager to resolve the problem. I then received a call to my room from the same manager as before, Rodolfo, who yelled at me that if I wanted extra beds, I should just pay for them or just share a bed. Unfortunately, the hotel and Priceline won the battle by just shutting off communication and refusing to remedy the problems. After much screaming, tearing hair out and long phone calls, we were forced to remain at the hotel and share beds, as well as paying hundreds of dollars just to park our cars. I am truly disgusted. My whole company are disgusted and please be assured that none of us will ever stay at a Holiday Inn or use Priceline again. Ever. An awful experience which ruined the entire trip. Is this what travel has come down to? Desperate hotels and booking companies letting morals fly out the window and adding charge after charge for meaningless nonsense such as a parking spot or an additional bed? One thing is clear - you are no longer a guest at a hotel, you are a cash cow, in every sense of the word. All in all I was quite pleased with the cleanliness and location, but from the bottom of my heart and speaking from alot of traveling experience, this was the worst and rudest staff and management my business partners and I have ever, ever encountered.

The hotel is virtually on W Century Blvd, right next to La Quinta Inn. The check in/out were very smooth. The staff at front desk and concierge were pleasant and professional. I was shocked to see dirt marks and hairs in the bathtub - there was also a hair in the basin. I was too tired to complain and organise the cleaning. I had had an 11 hour flight from UK and it was about 2am British time and all I wanted was a good quick soak in a bath and a warm drink before going to bed. I quickly cleaned the bath tub and basin with my body wash and a face towel. The bathroom remained unclean for the rest of my stay. Everyday when I came back, there were hairs on the floor, especially around the edges. The floor beneath the basin looked filthy with a couple of twisted tissue bits which seemed to have been wet then left dried, and also with other dirts. On the outside of the urinal there were areas which looked filthy with yellowish marks. The bedroom looked clean. The housekeeping remained generally poor. There was always something missing - sometimes there were no face towels. sometimes I had run out of shampoo and conditioner but these amenities had not been replaced. The hotel supplied coffee maker and free coffee but all they suppled with the machine were packets of coffee - there were no sugar/cream/stir bars. Sometimes there weren't even cups. These were never supplied unless I asked. it was not normal that I had to ring House Keeping dept so often for missing amenities. This was my 4th visit to LA and I have stayed at other 3 star hotels such as Holiday Inn Torrance and Hilton Garden Inn Lax/El Segundo (both were magical) - but the housekeeping at this hotel was the worst. Someone needs to supervise it. The furniture was slightly less than Holiday Inn Torrance but was decent enough. A small table and a mini fridge would have been nice. The hotel shuttle service was good and punctual, about every 15 mins, and all the drivers were helpful and efficient. I was a bit bothered with the airplane noise in the beginning but i god used to it after a few days. There was a constant rumbling sound in the distance and the airplane noise can get high occasionally. Despite that I slept so well - there were no flights roughly between 11pm and 6am, and the bed was so comfy! During my stay LA had record high temperatures but the room remained nice and cool, the air con was very quiet. The internet connection was not \"high speed\" as they advertise. It can get pretty slow at times. It took 25 mins to check in online. I did not bother using their business center (chargeable) to print the boarding pass as they can do that for you at Baggage Drop at the airport. They charge for parking but there were some free parking spaces (can fill up quickly) at the back of the hotel and the area looked ok, I saw locals jogging and taking a dog. In front of the hotel and McDonald (right beside the hotel with AmPm convenience store) I saw a couple of homeless people occasionally, but they seemed harmless. The reason why I chose to stay in a LAX hotel was that I was not going to have a car and the area had a good transport system. I often took hop on/off Ocean Express Trolly ($5 round trip) from the nearby stop to Manhattan Beach (gorgeous), Manhattan Village Mall and El Segundo Plaza (the organic shop Whole Foods was lovely). I took frequent Rapid 3 bus to Santa Monica ($1 one way), and to Downtown LA I took express 439 bus which takes a nicer route via Westchester and Culver City. There are also super shuttles to Disneyland and you could take train to Hollywood. I also went to Tom Bradley terminal at LAX to go to Pink's Hot Dogs and I did not have to queue. I did not use the hotel restaurant/lounge. There were fast food eateries nearby and you could cross the road and go to Starbucks or the Daily Grill in Westin Hotel. I bought my morning bread and fruit at whole Foods.

In this case, it was the opposite. I made reservations to stay here for only one night because my flight wasn't due to depart until the following morning, so based on the reviews and the fact that this hotel was \"supposedly\" newly renovated, I took the chance and booked with them. I've stayed at numerous hotels before and never have I encountered the type of service I received from this establishment. First of all, my flight was 2 hours late so by the time I arrived at the Holiday Inn, it was almost 1 am. When I arrived, the front desk was extremely busy checking in guests left and right, but there was no need for them to be so curt. (My callers also mentioned the front desk staff was not very friendly when they called asking for me.) As for the guestroom itself, it's nothing special and the pictures that are depicted online are not accurate. The rooms have been furnished with modern furniture, but was done rather quickly - which can be seen though the lack of \"quality\" and detail. Here's the issue that really bothered me: The following morning, the front desk woke me up at 8 am asking me if I was going to check out now?! I told them I had asked for an 8:30 am wake-up call and it didn't make any sense for them to start calling guests at 8 am when some people are still asleep AND the fact that check-out time isn't until 12 pm. THIS WAS THEIR RESPONSE: Most of the guests check out by this time (i.e. flight attendants, pilots, etc.) so if you do not want to be disturbed, you need to put your do not disturb sign outside your door. I was like \"WHAT!?\" Who in their right mind manages a hotel in this manner? I have never - repeat - NEVER encountered a hotel's check-out policy to this degree. So after being woken up already, I try to go back to sleep and can't so I just pack my stuff and go downstairs to check-out. When I go downstairs, I tell the desk clerk what happened and she explained the same thing to me like this was the norm. This is how I would sum up my stay here (and remember, I only stayed here a few hours and encountered these issues): 1. If you want to get a good night's sleep, do not stay here. 2. If you want to receive great guest service, do not stay here. 3. If you want to hear imcompetant excuses from an imcompetant staff, do not stay here. 4. If you want a higher quality guestroom with accurate picture depicting the room quality, do not stay here. Holiday Inn is not the brand it's being advertised to be and this hotel is a great example as to why. Next time, I will pay $30 or even $50 more so I can get at least a good night's sleep.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cNice airport hotel!\u201d", "Author": "BrianChiu", "ReviewID": "UR74214161", "Content": "Looks like it just renovated,room was clean and very comfy, no fridge in my room though; free WiFi and airport shuttle was excellent!

No compliant about their food at the inhouse restaurand and of course if you are scrimping for shopping or the touristy amusement park go get yourself a big mac at the McDonald just outside the hotel. I walked out further and found one or two other cafes but did not feel it was too safe for me to wander about the street having heard so much around the crime around the area. Anyhow it is foolhardy for anyone walking out past 9pm in search of pizza if Big Mac or the hotel restaurant won't do. The hotel is indeed retrofitted as you can see from the carpet and decor and fittings at the lobby which is businesslike though small but adequate. Overall, don't expect scenery outside your window as this is LAX and not Beverly Hills. I would recommend this hotel as opposed to the other motels nearby (which i prefer not to name) and if you could afford the time and the costs there are plenty of posh hotels downtown. One other warning to overseas tourists using this hotel - if you go on a disneyland whole day/late night trip don't stay till the fireworks finishes and miss your tour bus cos they will not wait more than 15 mins beyond schedule. If you missed, good luck to you as it would costs you more than a 100 bucks to take a taxi back to this hotel at LAX. Overall 3 star and value for money if you are on 2-3 day tour thus saving on car rental, time and fuel costs burnt up commuting.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cAnother Solid Stay at the HI LAX\u201d", "Author": "thebeerhunter", "ReviewID": "UR58668033", "Content": "We had to overnight at LAX at the last minute prior to heading to French Polynesia, due to a cyclone delaying our flight out.

The garage parking was not convenient to a hotel entrance when you have luggage to carry. There was no working ice machine on my floor or the next one up and I finally went to the hotel bar instead of climbing more stairs in search of one that worked. The tub was dripping a steady stream when we arrived but calling the front desk, room service, operator, or the concierge got me only a recording and it was only 9pm.

We opted for the less expensive and more convenient McDonald's about 30 yards from the front of the hotel. In order to check-out we had to wait in line again.

Pretty much only one elevator worked so you'd have to wait ages and then when you got an elevator you'd be crammed in because of all the people waiting. My room was actually okay. Nicer then I expected compared to the public hotel areas. Though when I got in both lamps beside my bed did not work. One lamp did not have a lightbulb in it and the other had a bulb that didn't work. So i had to unscrew a bulb from my desk lamp to put into my bed lamp. Ridiculous. As well there is apparently free wifi in the hotel but my signal was almost non existent. I called the front desk to tell them and they said it was because I was in a room at the end of hall, and I couldn't use ethernet because only the top floors had ethernet connections. So I had to go down to the desk to pick up some ridiculous internet kit that didn't make my signal better anyways. I was also annoyed that they put a $175 charge on my bill for the kit. I later found out the charge would be taken off when I returned the kit but no one told me of this charge in the first place. A hassle. As well my toilet didn't fully flush properly. I'd have to flush a couple of times for it to work. And I had a lovely view of the back of McDonalds from my room. The pool was pretty depressing. It overlooked another dingy looking hotel across the way. The service at the bar was nice though. Even though the bar area doesn't have a lot of character.

Basic rate is competitive, but then hotel charges you small amounts for nearly anything you use + like the PC&internet in the lobby (0,7$ per minute), parking lot (13$), breakfast (you get a coupon for 10$ for each person, which needs additional payment event for a continental buffet). They are also tipping themselves on your bill for breakfast service, even if you're having a buffet! This was pretty ridiculous. Be also aware of the noise, if you mind hearing aircrafts approaching the runway. The hotel is really close to airport and windows do not absorb all the noise.

My choice was between an executive room at this hotel or a standard room at the LAX Crowne Plaza for the same money. I chose this hotel for the added comfort the executive room would provide, but was sorely disappointed. When I booked in advance there was no notification on the website that construction work was taking place at the hotel and they happily charged me the extra over the cost of a standard room for an executive room. On arrival it was clear construction was taking place, we were then placed in an very old, tired room on a low floor, with scaffolding right outside the window. It was late and we'd had a long flight, so we just tried to get some sleep. But when construction work started in the early hours of the morning this was nye on impossible. On checkout I complained and was told that there were no executive rooms in the hotel during construction, all rooms were the sam3 - so why did they let me pay the extra for one?! I was told nothing could be done as I had paid in advance and I would need to contact the hotel manger directly. When I returned home I contacted the hotel and received no response, I then contacted IC Hotel Group and got no response. I followed up again and finally got a response, they requested the hotel contact me on a number of occasions, but they have still failed to do so. I appears they do not care! I have exchanged various emails with HI Customer Care in the US, but they seem to have their hands tied in terms of resolving any issues, and the best they would offer me was 4000 priority club points.

The check in clerk was very nice and set me up with a room facing away from Century Boulevard's noise, facing the back of the hotel, where my car was parked. The hallways were very dated, you know the pastel early 80's pink and mint green. Massive holes in the walls, dirty carpet and empty fire extinguisher holders!!! I was praying to the Holiday Inn gods that I wasnt going to spontaneously combust in the middle of the night. The room was also dated and had a faint smell of cigarettes dispite being a non-smoking room. The bed was so-so, the towels were scratchy and being stuck in a room next to the vending machines and ice machine didnt help my evening either. It was also a windy night, and the scaffolding was awaying more and the buns on J-Lo. Around 2am, I got hungry and decided that Taco Bell sounded like a good snack. That was the last time my car was in one peice. While loading my luggage into my SUV, I noticed something different. My third row seat was GONE! I walked over to the driver side and noticed that the thieves had drilled a hole under my door handle and opened the back. I immediately informed the head of hotel security, hoping that the security cameras had seen something. Oh, but wait...the hotel would need to have cameras to be able to catch something like that.

We checked several times to see if the window was open because it sounded like there was nothing between us and the construction. In fact, the windows are locked with a key and cannot be opened. We were also warned that due to the refurbishment, there was no coffee in the room. Actually, there was a coffee maker and coffee, the only thing missing was the cups. We could not figure out how this relates to the refurb. Free coffee was made available downstairs instead. From our point of view, the worst part of the stay was that everything is dirty. Even though the 5th floor is not under construction, the hallway carpets are filthy and ill-fitted, the hallways are very dim (to hide the dirt?), the room was OK except that there were numerous hairs lying around. The shower did not work properly - set the temperature and after a minute it goes straight to cold, yikes! The room decor is old and tired and not very clean, presumably the refurb will eventually extend to all floors... The restaurant food was OK, but many of the dishes were not clean.

The environment is not nearly as 'dangerous' as some have suggested, its LA and its in a non descript area. The Westin and other chains are very close as is the Thrifty rental office which is in walking distance. Again, very good value and comfortable.", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery Happy With This Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marie715", "ReviewID": "UR4465009", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised by my one night stay at this hotel. Check in was fast. The room was in excellent condition. It included a sofa and cocktail table and nice size desk. The king size bed included 5 pillows. Air conditioning seemed like a new unit and was very easy to control to the temperature I wanted it to be. I liked the touch of the manager calling in the evening (about 7:30pm) to ask if everything was in order and if I needed anything. The only minor thing that happened was that I went to the bar for their Happy Hour and hot hors'dourves but there were no hot hors'dourves. That was a very minor thing.

Reading the reviews I was not happy prior to departure. Fortunately, that changed. Upon arrival at LAX I called the hotel from the baggage claim area and was directed to go out to the proper location for pick-up. You must go to the area with the red sign for hotel transportation. Any other location, the bus may not stop. In 20 minutes the bus arrived and driver assisted with luggage. It was a short ride to the hotel. Check-in was fast, efficient and pleasant. Being a Priority Club member (joined prior to departure) got me a card for a 5% discount on food and drinks. A coupon for a complimentary drink at the lounge is provided at check-in (one per room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not per person). I requested a room at the back of the building after reading reviews concerning street noise on the front side. I was provided a room on the 8th floor, rear view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the building has 12 floors plus underground and street level parking. I would say that this Holiday Inn was a cut above the usual. I found it to be very clean in all areas from reception area, lounge, restaurant, pool, etc. Also the staff was very friendly and pleasant. The room was large with 3 slider type windows, one opened. Not the best view but far from the worst I have encountered. Actually, in the evening it was a nice view of the city lights. From the lower levels it would not be so great so ask for a room at the top. Street noise was not a problem on this side of the building and at this level. Yes, you can see the planes landing but they are not that close. The room was equipped as you would expect. The furniture was in very good condition with the exception of the couch that was showing some wear. The bed was comfortable. Carpeting was clean and in good condition. An iron and ironing board is in the room. Standard bathroom, very clean but lacked an exhaust fan. Hallway and elevators were very clean and well maintained. The business center was equipped with two computers and a printer. The outdoor heated pool is next to the fitness center. We used our coupon at the lounge and of course opted for a few more! The bar can accommodate about ten persons. The lounge area has about 20 tables and several wall mounted televisions. We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant. Previous reviews stated the food was not bad and I would agree. A little, maybe a lot better than you might expect. The restaurant is fairly large and has a buffet area and is very clean. Breakfast buffet is available at $9.95 or you order from the menu. On the first evening an employee delivered two bottles of water with a container of ice. A complimentary copy of USA Today was delivered each morning. Previous comments regarding the location are accurate. For a business traveler I would say this would be an excellent location with proximity to LAX, freeway and parking. A tourist would have to take the location into consideration. While there are no restaurants in close proximity and taxis are fairly expensive, there is a free trolley service from in front of the Clarion Hotel (next to the Holiday Inn) to Manhattan Beach. It makes 8 stops along the route. You can stroll the beach and pier, shopping area, mall and review several good restaurants. This is an excellent service and departs every hour. Pick up the trolley schedule in the hotel lobby. Overall, I was very satisfied with the Holiday Inn.", "Date": "January 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakhurst, Ca", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "Oakhursttraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3461964", "Content": "Very convenient to the airport.

I am not sure what the complaint was about the shuttle to the airport. It ran every 20 minutes 24 hours a day. Driver courteous and helpful. Desk staff very friendly and helpful.

I would expect any hotel near the airport would have the same problem as most are on Century Blvd. Beside the traffice noise, the business center was very expensive to use so there is an internet cafe across the street at much better rates (although crossing Century blvd was hazardous!).
