After that we went upstairs to the concierge desk to ask for a personal shopper. The concierge kindly let us know because we weren't guests of the hotel he couldn't help us with the request. He recommended us to go to our own hotel's concierge desk. (If the 4 seasons staff want to follow up with their employee, please talk to the South American colleague with black glasses frame) I mean after spending nearly 2K at the SPA I was very disappointed to get this kind of answer.

Its the best in Paris and amongst the very best in the world...\u201d", "Author": "Goodmorning2U_11", "ReviewID": "UR123119550", "Content": "We have been very fortunate to stay several times at the Four Seasons and are so glad to return when we are in Paris. My most recent stay, was no different, only better! I don't know how the team at the George V manages to improve the guest experience every time, but they do. Much has been said about the amazing service, rooms, spa, and food so I will try to report on only those parts of my experience which are not so often commented upon. Public Decor for the Holidays: The first thing I noticed when I walked into the lobby was the warm light from Christmas trees made out of light. This is simply magical and very appropriate for Paris, the City of Lights! When I walked out to the courtyard I saw a forest of perfect evergreens with another tree of light glowing in the middle. I'm not one to be effusive about flower arrangements but this is really special. We didn't stay during Christmas or New Years this year but will now look forward to planning a stay there during this time in the future. Service: I arrived very early in the morning but Celine at the front desk was very gracious about welcoming me and was very sincere in her efforts/hope that my room would be ready as soon as possible. I headed straight for my favorite place to have breakfast, Le V. Food: Amongst the very best breakfasts in the world. If you enjoy breakfast you absolutely must leave the wonderful comfort of your room and dine in the Le V. They offer an amuse bouche of creme brulee in the mornings, and fresh brewed as well as Nespresso to get the day started right. If you enjoy eggs benedict this is the place to enjoy it. I'm a bit of a connoisseur and have tried them at the Crillon, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz, Lauderee...and Le V is the best! Don't miss out on their hot chocolate with natural vanilla or cinnamon options. For dinner I didn't feel like dressing up so enjoyed the V menu in my room. I highly recommend this option (and the lunch menu is great value/delicious). Spa: I had four massages and a facial. Frankly, I'm not the same person I was before the treatments. I still feel fantastic and its been two weeks since I've been back to the States. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the young woman who gave me the men's facial but she was superb. It was my first facial but not my last. Tip: all of the massage therapists are best in class. Some places I worry that I'm not going to get a good therapists, not here. I don't know if they all went to the same school but they use a similarly peerless technique. The manager of the spa deserves every accolade. And, if she isn't in charge of a region for the Four Seasons spas (of if they don't do this yet) they should promote her. The gym is also very well attended and equipped. If you have time definitely relax in the sauna, steam room, and relaxation room. Rooms: The hotel is currently going through a soft renovation. The style is still very classic but is updated. I will miss the damask and the gilt bronze door pulls but the added technology, new mirrors, tvs, are a big improvement. They are doing a fantastic job with the renovation but I wouldn't worry about getting a renovated room (there isn't a big difference). Tips: make reservations in the evening if you would like to eat at the Galleria or the Bar, they will do their best to welcome you but they are often to capacity. It is worth flying to Paris from around the world if but only to enjoy the chocolate souffle with cassis. If you are going to Paris this is the best option, by a wide margin. For a quick comparison-I had breakfast and toured the rooms and spa of the Mandarin Oriental and I feel sorry for the owners of this property. It just doesn't compare to the George V and charges similar prices. I also toured Le Meurice which is a lovely hotel but again felt that it doesn't compare to the Four Seasons (i.e. I stood waiting at the front desk for more than a few minutes before anyone asked me if I had been helped and the spa is a disaster). If you are going to Paris, stay at the George V, you are sure to have a magical stay in the City of Lights.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNothing but the best!\u201d", "Author": "JanValasek", "ReviewID": "UR123019536", "Content": "First trip to Paris, first time away from the kids with my wife and we could not stay in a better hotel.

I wanted to fall in love with this storied hotel as so many other reviewers seemingly have. Unfortunately, my experience left a lot to be desired. The George V has built a reputation on providing its guests with unparalleled service, but it is precisely in this area that it failed me most stunningly. I found the concierge to be particularly unhelpful and frustrating. They were dismissive and I often felt like I was being shooed away. On our first night in Paris, they booked a reservation for us on the Yacht de Paris. I approached the concierge desk a couple of times before leaving for our dinner cruise and each time I was told to come back later. I finally called from our room and a woman told me to stop by a few minutes before we were heading out to pick up a card with the information on the reservation. I did just that and noticed that there wasn\u2019t a complete street address noted on the card. I mentioned this to the concierge and he shooed me away and told me I\u2019d be fine\u2014that any taxi driver would be able to find it. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case and our driver struggled to find the location. Additionally, we didn\u2019t know what to expect from the menu at the Yacht de Paris. We learned at dinner that the only entr\u00e9e offered that evening was lamb. Neither I nor my traveling companion care for lamb so we made due with bread, but it would have been nice to know such information beforehand. We would have maybe eaten a little something in advance or found an alternative to the Yacht de Paris. The next evening, we tried to make reservations at Le Cinq located inside the hotel and we were told the restaurant was booked for the next week. We called the concierge and asked for alternatives. I specifically asked for a few options. It was a special evening and I didn\u2019t want to take any chances on dinner so I wanted this to be a more collaborative effort. I never heard back from the concierge. Instead, an hour or so later, a messenger deliverd a card to our room with our reservation for the evening. When I called to inquire about what had happened (i.e., what happened to providing us with some options) I was met with indignation. The last straw was when I asked for a recommendation for a nearby coffee/pastry shop. The concierge recommended Laduree. When I asked where it was, he scribbled something on a map and told me it was easy to find. At that point, I\u2019d had enough. I never asked the concierge for anything else. Instead, we contacted the concierge at the Ritz London (we were there the week prior and returning for a few more days after Paris) who recommended a great tour company in Paris. We leaned heavily on our tour guide for places to visit and where to eat and shop, etc. We also had a disappointing breakfast at La Gallerie on our second morning. The staff was scrambling to remember our orders. It was a disaster (runny and undercooked eggs; lumpy cr\u00e8me; they forgot to bring orange juice; they forgot to bring toast for the eggs; they forgot to bring a clean cup for tea, etc.). It was a shame because breakfast the day before was impeccable. Unfortunately, the second morning\u2019s experience left such a bad impression on us that we skipped breakfast altogether the next day. Finally, on our second night at George V, we had to phone the night manager twice because we were kept awake by very loud techno music from the room next to us. She didn\u2019t do anything the first time so we recorded the noise on our I-phone and she eventually sent someone up and it stopped at around 2:30 am. The next day there was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience\u2014not a call or a note. Certainly, nothing I\u2019ve described is the end of the world. However, for a hotel that touts its service above all else, the George V failed us terribly. I sincerely hope that our experience is an anomaly--that other guests are welcomed warmly and treated with more respect than we were afforded.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pisa, Italy", "Title": "\u201cup to 4 seasons high standards\u201d", "Author": "PRESItaly", "ReviewID": "UR122351041", "Content": "We have stayed in a suite for 3 nights, and everything was perfect.

Be it for the magnificent building, the exquisite rooms and designs or the uttermost friendly staff, miraculously being able to adress you with your real name wherever you go \u2013 this hotel fulfills even the highest standarts. And what is especially astounding is that this hotel manages to offer pure abundance without the decadence you might feel, say, in the Burj al Arab. However, there wer two little disappointments this time. First of all, the wifi is a mere catastrophe. The \"normal\" wifi package offers very slow wifi only and is already expensive. The expensive package offers ok-speed wifi but is ridiculously expensive. Besides the fact that it seems very avaricious of a hotel in which the cheapest room lies around 1200$ to charge for wifi in the first place, it simply is a cumbersome system. For the second disappointment it is to be said that we have visited the George V very many times. Although it is clear that we cannot expect an upgrade it was a bit disappointing that we didnt get one this year, although we have gotten one each and every other time. Also we usually found a small handwritten welcome card in our room welcoming us back to the GV which this year was replaced by a standart printed \"with our compliments\" card. It is not of great importance, but sometimes it is the small things leaving a big impression. Although these two disappointments I want to end this review with the biggest plus of the hotel, namely the staff. In the George V you usually dont fell as a paying guest, but rather as a normal guest. The staff really seems to find some fun i offering great service beyond the pure do-ut-des relation, it just seems to like working there.

From the doormen to the receptionists to the dining staff and to every staff member we ever encountered (must be over 40 in five days) \u2013 there was not one individual who was not gracious and friendly. The service surpassed what we have previously experienced in many five star hotels and even on numerous five star cruises. During our stay in early October, we were given room 225, which is a very quiet Superior room overlooking the beautiful marble courtyard. The room was absolutely immaculate with a chandelier and a stunning blue granite bathroom. The hotel is meticulously maintained with nary a sign of wear. The gorgeous lobby with fresh flowers changed almost daily is a site to behold. While meals and drinks were quite expensive (as are most things in Paris) by American standards, the service we received made everything seem reasonable. The prix fixe lunch at Le Cinq (85 euros/per person) was a good deal and the food was superb \u2013 especially the desserts. For comparison, appetizers and main courses on the ala carte menu were 70 to 140 euros, so a three course meal would cost about 250-300 euros per person, not including alcohol. The George V is in a great location \u2013 a hundred yards from the Champs-Elysees and within what is called the \u201cGolden Triangle,\u201d which is an upscale area filled with designer boutiques. The hotel is also adjacent to a Metro stop making it extremely convenient for access to all of Paris. All in all, we tremendously enjoyed the Parisians and by making a little effort with the French language, found them to be very warm and friendly. I think those who criticize the French for being rude are usually those who expect to be treated in France exactly the same as they are in the United States. A few words of French, such as \u201cbonjour\u201d and \u201cmerci\u201d go a long way to help create a pleasant experience for all. While we have found the Australians to be the world\u2019s friendliest people, this visit proved to us that the French are not far behind when treated with understanding and respect.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Andrews, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with excellent, friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "MrsNP712", "ReviewID": "UR119563712", "Content": "We went there for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful time.

I did book an executive suite, but still did not really know what to expect since I had never stayed at a FourSeasons. We arrived early so our room was not ready. We checked in and the staff was unbelievably sweet and pleasant. I have been to Paris many times and have spent time in hotels of similar quality and those that are quaint, but I have never been to a hotel where every single person was so helpful and cheerful. We went shopping until our room was ready. They called when it was ready and to our delight, they informed us that they were able to give us three upgrades. I love to stay at really nice hotels, but I have never seen anything like this room! It was beautiful and the service was amazing. We had wine, sweets, water, ice...Everthing was catered to us. It was truly a dream vacation in a beautiful city. Plus, which made it so much nicer, the staff was so wonderful. Personally the only drawback for me is that the location was not in a spot that I was used to. It ended up being fine because we took taxis to most of the places, but I usually prefer to walk and it was far for my mother to walk to some of the museums.

We certainly did not feel at home here.The only other time that this feeling occurred was when we both went to the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. The staff at the George V were okay but not overly friendly or (I personnally felt) would not go that extra mile. It was like they knew we were not Billionaires and perhaps felt that they needed to treated us differently. The rooms were nothing special. We stayed in a King Size deluxe room and it looked like it was in need of a refurbishment. Hidden inside the TV cabinet lurks a monster (cathode-ray tube) TV. I was surprised as I thought that given the amount of guests that stay here and the prestige of this hotel, a flat screen TV would be expected. As usual with Four Seasons there are no freebies except that our room rate was bed and breakfast and came with two bottles of water at turn down. The cost of the laundry for two ladies trousers, a pair of undergarments and blouse was a mere 120 euros. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is truly beautiful and the location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping.

The classy and elegant uniforms that flows from the Le Cinq ,Le Bar to the smart yet chic uniforms of the staff at the gallery and terrace flows beautifully. The George V service standards take you beyond the norm of expectation n blow your mind.

We booked our travel through Centurion and decided to book the deluxe rooms for a total of 10 nights. An upgrade is given on check in if available this was not available at check in so I was pleased we had splurged on the higher level room. How wrong I was! The rooms we were taken to after our long flight from Australia were dreadful. They were at the back end of the hotel and overlooked a 1970's office building eyesore. The rooms were small and well worn and smelled bad - assistant manager agreed with all our comments. We were appalled and were assured these rooms were 'deluxe' rooms even though they looked nothing like the deluxe rooms on the website. We were told no upgrade was possible even if we wanted to pay for an upgrade as the hotel was very busy. We were then told there was another two 'deluxe' rooms at a different part of the hotel would be available late in the afternoon - this was after haggling for an hour and deciding we would not be staying 10 nights in the room they allocated to us - effectively putting them on notice we would be checking out. The next 'deluxe' rooms were so very different it dismayed us further as we felt the hotel had put us in a basic room at the beginning and was still wanting to charge us for a deluxe room. Beware as the rooms in this hotel are so very different even if you assured by the staff of the room catagory. Trust is important and they lost it with us here. There are major issues with soundproofing in this hotel. We heard every word of the conversations of our neighbours and heard the people above us tapdancing and doors slaming constantly. The building work next door had drilling and hammering going on day and night. Thank goodness we were not planning on spending much time in the room. For those that like to relax back on holiday and have in days this hotel won't suit you. Room service was a joke. The poor delivery people would be missing things on every delivery. We ordered room service daily because we have young kids so got to know the wait staff. They were embarressed to say the least and complained that the kitchen is so busy the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The quality and service here was so poor the F&B manager ought to be ashamed. We were sent meals missing sauces, Meat that was overcooked, condiments that had been opened and used by other guests. Butter but no bread. Cheese missing from Pasta. Pots of coffee where we only ordered a cup (charged for a pot of course!). This became a bit of a running joke with us and simply should not be the case in an establishment like this. When one of the delivery people moved a chair out of our room to the kids room for their breakfast tray the wait person smashed the chair into the chandelier that shattered glass all over us and our breakfast. No offer to replace our breakfast covered in glass, thank goodness we were nearly done anyway. I sent my daughter and her little friend for a pedi at the spa - bit of 8 and 9 year old pampering. They charged adult prices and the job was appalling. Polish was slapped on so badly I thought the girls had done their own toes.

If it takes a bit for them to figure it out, they are very good to let you know they are working on it. I think the only time I noticed an issue with service was the difference between Le Cinq & Le Galerie. There are either more servers in Le Cinq or the servers are given fewer tables to attend, as each time our Le Cinq visits have been incredible. We have eaten breakfast in the restaurants about 6X, mostly in Le Cinq. I do love the central location of the hotel, as I love to walk, but taxis seem readily available. Our favorite referral from the hotel is the upscale Italian restaurant: Mori Venice Bar, which we have been twice (once July 2011, and in July 2009), which does require a taxi to/from the restaurant.

We have traveled around the world and stayed at as many Four Seasons properties as we can afford and promised ourselves the next time we go to Paris, we HAVE to stay at George V. The longing that we had after reading every \"world's best\" lists and seeing the George V usually at the top made us want to make that dream a reality this time around in Paris. We were crossing our fingers it wouldn't be overrated and worth our money. I'll tell you why we weren't disappointed and went beyond expectations. You don't need to hear about the gorgeous and spacious rooms--it looks just like the website. Or the insanely beautiful flower arrangements, the elegant lobby, the incredibly fresh French pastries at breakfast, the designer bath products (Bulgari), you get the idea...But at this level of a hotel, what we've come to realize is that what you are paying for is the service. That's exactly why my husband and I keep coming back to the Four Seasons. Never mind that everyone greets you as Mr. or Mrs. so-and-so. If you go to enough Four Seasons to know, that's included. What you do need to hear about is the fact that when my husband went to the concierge and showed them some postcards the girls wanted to send, before he could finish \"would you....\" they finished his sentence and said, \"we'll be happy to send those for you.\" The postcards didn't have stamps yet and he was about to mention it but they also noticed and said \"we'll take care of that for you as well.\" Never saw a charge for stamps either. Or when we were leaving one day after breakfast, our waiter asked us if he could pack us some chocolate croissants for our day out--we didn't refuse and no extra charge as well, just a dash of excellent service. How about when one of the waitstaff overheard one of my girls describing to her sister the tool they used to break a soft-poached egg since she saw someone using it and thought it was the coolest thing and the other girl had no idea what she was talking about, he brought it over to our table and showed the girls how it was used. I don't know how they do it but the attention they give their guests make people talk about it over and over or feel compelled to write about it on Tripadvisor! This Four Seasons also certainly exceeds others we've been to, although the property at Jimbaran Bay in Bali and Hualalai, Hawaii are close seconds. The location is perfect--close to the Champs-Elysee and noise but not on it and in the middle of 2 metro stations. The metro in Paris is one of the easiest in the world to use--no joking, and you don't have to speak a lick of French. Very economical as well and can take you all over Paris--at least to most if not all of the places that toursists come to Paris to see. Over 12 days in France and England and 4 different hotels, with the first being the Four Seasons GV, and one of them an ancient chateau, my husband and I and our 3 girls, went to bed every night dreaming we were still at the Four Seasons.

We planned to stay 5 nights, and ended up leaving, with great regret, after 10 days in the most beautiful hotel in the most beautiful city! This was an especially precious trip, as a medical emergency almost derailed our wedding. (Indeed, we needed to postpone our wedding - at a different Four Seasons - and were actually married in a hospital, \"just in case\". Fortunately, the originally planned arrangements were simply rescheduled just as planned, but a few months later. Our Honeymoon was similarly delayed by more than a year. Given this background, and the fact that this was a marriage later in life, we decided to splurge, realizing that we almost missed it all entirely...) The planning was easy, with direct contact with the Concierge, who returned all calls to the States at times requested. We gladly accepted the suggestion to be met at the Airport and assisted through to a car service, and this was a *great* decision. We were met immediately, helped with our luggage retrieval, and then escorted immediately through customs/immigration, bypassing all of the lines. (a very welcome relief after a less than stellar flight on American Airlines, where our first class seats were downgraded to business class (refund REFUSED!?) AND one of the seats didn't recline at all, and there was a note attached so American obviously knew about the problem.) We arrived early at the George V (and our ONLY disappointment during the entire stay was that we were NOT offered refreshments, nor offered a chance to use the Spa and pool, or a massage, while we sat for a few HOURS with merely some coffee). ALL disappoinment vanished when we were taken to an upgraded room with a *full* view of the Eiffel Tower! We were greeted by name every time we walked through the fabulous lobby (how *do* they remember names!?), and the Concierge helped with every request and reservation, large or small. One VERY special treat was to book a \"couples massage\" in the private spa room, and we booked an additional two hours there afterwards, and rose petals and champagne awaited us next to the included private spa (large hot tub), along with other refreshments waiting. We could have spent the entire day,,. The wall murals at the pool were just as charming as pictured, but the pool was much smaller than it had appeared. No problem, as that was not why we were there! Housekeeping was immaculate and discreet, and scheduled at our request. We had planned to visit surrounding areas after 5 days in Paris, but everything was so perfect, that we were delighted to find that we could extend our stay. (We had inadvertantly arrived just as the French Open was about to start, so having availability was no small feat!) We stopped by the other top hotels, either to browse, for a drink, or a meal, and all we can say is that EVERYTHING written about the rudeness elsewhere was true, and there wasn't even a hint of it at the Georges V! (The \"best\" experience elsewhere was late cocktails at the Plaza Athenee where we were served and then generally ignored - so we didn't bother with a second drink after waiting too long for anyone to appear to ask - but at least the service wasn't outright rude.) The concierge's suggestions were all excellent, from the transportation to Giverny, to small restaurants and cafes. We had a real treat at Versailles, because our room service waiter at breakfast that morning (we usually ate in the cafe, at the same table each morning) suggested we rent \"golf carts\". Golf carts at Versailles? Yes - and so after the inside tour, we found the little rental kiosk, waited a brief time for one to be returned, and spent the rest of the day scooting around the grounds, seeing so much more than we ever could have on foot! As others have commented (before our stay and after), there was a little \"problem\" with the bill: There were charges that we simply had not made. Given the total of our bill, it wasn't a lot extra, but we objected, in principle, to what is clearly a general practice: Either they hope one will not scrutinize the bill carefully, or that one will feel too awkward to protest. We noticed, and we definitely protested, although it took a very long time and a seemingly endless number of people who needed to get involved. THIS WAS *NOT* A WAY TO TREAT DEPARTING GUESTS; it definitely left a bad taste as the \"most recent experience\" of what otherwise had been everything that we had hoped for, and more... We have stayed at other 5-star properties in the USA and Europe (including three favorites, Surich's Dolder Grand, Vienna's Bristol, and our other real favorite, Claridges in London); unfortunately nothing in the USA truly compares with these, in atmosphere or service. [One of the newer Four Season's, in Seattle, is one of the least appealing \"luxury\" hotels ever! Its location is offputting, in what remains of the \"seamy\" underside of the city, and we decided to leave before we even checked in. (Whoever chose that site for a \"Four Seasons\" is presumably working elsewhere now!) The \"name\" alone does *not* guarantee anything! We returned immediately to the *former* \"Four Seasons\" hotel in Seattle, the Olympic - now a Fairmont. In addition to the better location, it has the \"Old World Elegance\" of the grand European hotels, although some rooms could benefit from some updating. Indeed, this was where we had our delayed wedding earlier, and we stayed in the grand suite that we were told - much to our surprise and dismay - was recently showcased on \"The Bachelor\"...] We've also stayed in several smaller and/or lesser rated hotels, where truly superb service was also present... and in far too many where it was not. TripAdvisor has been a real help; sorting through occasional cranky reviews, it's the \"general/overall\" reviews that have been truly helpful, with both occasional unexpected \"finds\", and avoiding places we might otherwise have headed...

I had heard good things about the George V from several friends who had stayed there in the past, so agreed to pay 850E/night for a basic double room. The good news is that we booked a regular room online and were kindly offered an \u201cupgrade\u201d to a larger room because of the special occasion. Upon my request, we were also given a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne at arrival. I appreciated the complimentary boot shine. The hotel itself is beautiful and the spa/fitness area is wonderful. Everything is very clean and very tastefully done. The staff (lots of them) are all very polite -- I didn't perceive them as insincere but some might. Otherwise, I\u2019m giving the hotel possibly my worst review ever on trip advisor. I wrote a complaint letter to the president of the company and have cut and pasted it into this review for your benefit. I'd never before felt the need to write a complaint letter about a hotel. We had to call housekeeping twice to get an ironing board brought into the room. I woke up ill, having forgotten to request only synthetic pillows and bed linens due to a down allergy. As we headed out around 10 a.m. on a Saturday, I asked a woman at the front desk to have all of the down pillows and comforter removed from the room. She politely said she would have it taken care of immediately and even picked up the phone as we were walking away. We returned to the room around 2 so that I could take a nap, still suffering from an allergic reaction to the down. I was too tired to look closely to ensure the change had been made \u2013 but feeling even worse after a 2 hour nap, I realized that housekeeping failed to change the pillows and comforter as promised. I called housekeeping and they called back right away at least 2 times and sent someone to make the change. The hotel didn\u2019t have a synthetic comforter in the appropriate size \u2013 so I was given a king/queen synthetic comforter on my twin bed. The maid was delightful and very apologetic and calling other staff members frantically using a mobile phone while in our room in a valiant effort to correct the situation. I told her it wasn\u2019t a big deal because she was so kind and trying so hard \u2013 and indeed it wasn\u2019t a big deal to sleep with an oversized comforter that dragged on the floor \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t the type of service I expected at 1200 USD/night. I requested a morning FT using the form provided \u2013 it never showed up \u2013 even though someone took the form off the doorknob. We were woken up every morning by the construction going on next-door. They clearly try to minimize the noise -- but a hammer is still a hammer at 8 a.m. In the mornings, I went to the lovely spa/fitness area for coffee and to read the FT that I knew would be there. I was looking forward to coffee and the FT in the room \u2013 but didn\u2019t want to risk room service forgetting the paper and/or waiting for forever for room service to even show up. The spa attendants were generally very polite, one even gave us a very nice tour of the facilities. However, one of the spa attendants on the day I left was dreadful. As I sat there drinking coffee from the free coffee/tea/water bar area and quietly reading the paper \u2013 entirely alone in the area \u2013 I sensed her displeasure with my presence. I did a quick workout and took a cup of coffee from the bar up to the room. She looked at me as if I had taken a painting off the wall. I apologize for my stereotypical \u201cugly American\u201d behavior of drinking coffee from a to-go cup \u2013 but at 1200 USD/night, *nothing* should have led that spa attendant to look at me in such a way. I was dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, just like all of the other folks going to and from the gym. And I was told specifically that the coffee was free \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an area only for patrons awaiting treatments. The worst thing that happened of all \u2013 a woman, seemed to be a maid, came into my room quietly \u2013 without knocking \u2013 at 8:30 on Monday morning!!! I have NEVER had this happen, ANYWHERE. My friend had left for London about 1 hour before, so perhaps someone was sent to check on the room \u2013 but not phoning first or knocking on the door is simply unacceptable under any circumstances. Fortunately, I was putting my shoes on and saw her just as she put her first step into the room. I don\u2019t know if she was sneaking in to see what she could take \u2013 or what \u2013 but she quickly apologized and left. At checkout, I was made to wait for 15-20 minutes until a \u201ccashier\u201d who could handle the payment transaction for my room was available. The 2 polite women at the front desk each said that they were only in training and couldn\u2019t process payment. I had a nice conversation with a polite Swedish clerk \u2013 but I still sat there waiting for a really, really long time. She asked about my stay and indeed I told her about a few of my complaints that she wrote down -- but I didn't want to create a ruckus in such a quiet, lovely lobby with so many folks coming/going. I assume that because I carried my 2 small bags downstairs myself, they sent someone upstairs to check the room before letting me leave. This is understandable, of course, but it was very awkward to have to wait for so long. Maybe they were telling me the truth and they couldn\u2019t in fact run my credit card for the room \u2013 but to make a guest wait for 15-20 minutes at 11 a.m. on a Monday to check out is ridiculous. If I was going to be made to wait for so long, they should have offered to have me wait in the bar area and given me a cup of coffee or water. No one else was waiting to check out \u2013 I was standing alone w/the clerks at the registration desk. Finally, a \u201ccashier\u201d showed up who showed me the bill. Someone had charged 18E for 2 coffees over the weekend onto the room that my friend and I did not have. I told the \u201ccashier\u201d that these were not my coffees and asked to see the signed receipt for them. He got a rather disgusted look on his face and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just take them off.\u201d He clearly thought I was lying, and it was somewhat embarrassing. I meekly responded, \u201cI am paying 18E for a local phone call to make lunch plans\u201d to indicate that I wasn\u2019t trying to argue with the prices for things I had used. (As you can imagine, the prices there are ridiculous -- so I can't really complain but you should be aware -- I paid 18E for a brief local call and 10E for a coke from the minibar. 25E for a cocktail. 40 - 50E for a cheeseburger. I didn't pay the 22E/day for internet access.) My friend and I are not regular guests at Four Seasons and I we checked in using tourist passports. Perhaps we were considered \u201clow rent\u201d guests, and thought we could be ignored as such. In any case, it wasn\u2019t what I expected for the price \u2013 I would have been disappointed for half the price. Even in Paris you can do just fine at 425 E/night MANY places. If this is your first trip to Paris and you don't have a full-time hired car, you may not like the location. You might try the Meurice or Crillon -- each of which has a much better location for a first-time visitor to Paris. I can't say this experience ruined the trip -- but it certainly would have if we hadn't tried not to think of it, especially considering the price. Neither one of us would ever stay there again \u2013 nor would we recommend it to anyone for anything other than afternoon tea or one cocktail (make a reservation to ensure a table) before the bar gets too crowded with exceedingly flashy nouveau riche types and the band in the very beautiful lounge starts playing \"Kalinka\" and other Russian hymns.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnquestionably superb\u201d", "Author": "NW8Roamer", "ReviewID": "UR103334144", "Content": "Two nights spent at the George V to celebrate my girlfriend's 30th birthday have left me speechless.

However, I can't give it the same ranking I gave the Four Seasons London Park Lane. Or any other Four Seasons for that matter. There are a few issues that need to be resolved. I'll start with the bar. When I pay $1,500 a night for a room, I expect to be able to stop in for a drink at my hotel bar. Not here. I was turned away and told to go to my room and they would call when there is availability. That's a first for me at any hotel, and especially at a Four Seasons. I complained to the manager but he just said, \"sorry\". That's a major problem and it wasn't just one night. 2 of the 3 nights we walked down the street to have a drink. That really bothered me! The other night we went early enough to beat the crowd. I really wanted to see what was so great about this bar. It was a typical hotel bar. Nice, pricey, but nothing terribly special. The other issue is the renovation taking place on the upper floors. One morning it started at 8:00 and woke us up. I guess they had numerous complaints because the next morning it started much later. Do they really need to be told that 8:00 it too early for a jack hammer and drilling? The biggest issue that I had with the hotel is that it's very stuffy. I'm not sure it that was this hotel or just typical nice Paris hotels. Some of the people were great. As a matter of fact, most of the servers were great! The hotel just has a stuffy feel especially after coming from the Four Seasons in London where the hotel had a cool, fun feel.

After a leisurely breakfast in the lobby, we were able to get our room early. We travel often and my husband said that the bed at the George V was the most comfortable bed that he's ever slept on. I spent time in the spa one day. I don't think the deluxe pedicure is worth the price, but the atmosphere was wonderful.

Alas, our 'home' wasn't available for the first few nights of our stay in Paris and so we decided to book the George V for our first 2 nights in Paris. The experience was exceptional. The hotel presents perfectly, as we've come to expect from Four Seasons properties. Expect uber-luxe! Huge tapestries, an abundance of floral arrangements (which interestingly are rotated throughout the hotel three times a day), gold gilt, staff everywhere who address you by name. The experience is without a doubt special. But you do pay for it! Our nightly rate was just over $1500AUD. And for this, we received an exquisite room with a sumptuous bed, a bathroom covered in marble, a view of the Eiffel Tower, and a standard continental breakfast. Admittedly, the china upon and in which our croissants and (mediocre) coffees were served were beautiful. But really, you get very little else. Dining, room service, laundry, internet, and just about everything else is pretty much 'robbery'. But you're in Paris, and this is the George V.

It is a case of 'if you have to ask, you can't afford it!' Honestly. For those wanting to visit Paris as a 'tourist' with a healthy serving of Parisienne pomp and glamour - stay here. The location is superb for those with a preference for being driven around rather than catching the metro or walking. Avenue de Montaigne (where ALL the fashion boutiques are, and my personal must-do) is just down the road.

Because of its unique location and architecture, the GEORGE V cannot be compared with the other luxury hotels in the French capital. Staying at the GEORGE V is an invaluable experience ! The royal standard of service which all guests benefit from, puts the GEORGE V in a league of its own. The beautiful antiques throughout the hotel, the most spectacular flower arrangements and its top cuisine are just some of the key features of this palace hotel in the heart of Paris. Unfortunately, fame and reputation have given the Four Seasons George V an air of sufficiency, even arrogance, assuming an unbeatable international leadership. More than 10 years since it reopened as a Four Seasons, the hotel hasn't been renovated. Many would argue that the hotel does not need such major renovations in a relatively short period of a luxury palace hotel type. However, in today's luxury standards, it is unacceptable that the George V hasn't changed many essentials. Towels look and feel used, most probably in use for more than two years. The bed linen is so old, the labels have become white, not showing any information (brand, quality, year etc) and also some bed linen have slightly different colours. As for the bathroom, it is unacceptable for such as hotel to use artificial cosmetics, heavily fragranced and containing only artificial ingredients. The snobbish factor of a brand such as BVLGARI no longer suffices and discerning travellers are already enjoying pure organic products at competing hotel chains. As in all other major capitals of the world, it has taken Four Seasons to be ''woken up'' by openings of Mandarin Oriental, which have taken almost immediately the leading position in each city. Mandarin Oriental opens in Paris late 2010 and it is likely to claim its leading position in Paris within a few months.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, wa", "Title": "\u201cDecent enough, but not our favorite Paris hotel\u201d", "Author": "seattletraveller2007", "ReviewID": "UR60592113", "Content": "There isn't anything that's actually bad about this Four Seasons. It's up to scratch in all the ways you expect Four Seasons to be - opulent lobby with nice contemporary artwork, very nice public spaces, great restaurant and bars. It just lacks a little personality compared to other places. It fancies itself as the \"Grand Dame\" of Paris \"palace\" hotels, but arguably Crillon / Ritz / Bristol are more \"characterful\". The service here was also just a bit \"off\" - a little disinterested, more than anything. Could be it's resting on its laurels a little. There's just a hint of eurotrash about some of the guests, which unfortunately some of the staff seemed to pander to, and which gives a hotel a very different vibe to a comparable property in, say, NYC. However, I'd give special praise to the Cinq restaurant. Fantastic service, just the right balance of unobtrusive and engaged, and very different to the stuffiness you get somewhere like Le Grand Vefour. Try the spectacular tasting menu with paired wines for a gastronomic treat (but be ready to drop $1000+). Place is a bit overpriced even by Paris standards. Location is great if you want to be around Champs Elysee, but the area is a bit of a tourist trap.

I am fortunate enough to have stayed in a number of Four Seasons Hotels particularly in Asia. My experiences have always been extremely positive and would recommend the hotels in HK, Bali and Mauritius particulalry. My experiences however at Goerge V were significantly different, many items were small issues but all left a feeling of extremly poor service and a complete lack of regard for the guest. The items contributing to this were as follows: We had asked for an early check-in but this was not available which was fine so we all went for some lunch and came back at the suggested check in time later in the afternoon. We had three rooms booked two of which were now ready for use. The remaining room was not ready for another 3 hours. There was a cursory apology but nothing more. When we finally got to the last room the luggage was delivered but had been damaged between reception and the room. The room although non-smoking smelt strongly of smoke. The ladies were booked in for a spa. The marble floor in the Spa was wet and my mother slipped and fell badly. The hotel nurse was called, she called a dcotor who duly arrived. The doctor felt my mother needed to go to hospital so teh hotel staff pointed her and my father (both in their 70's) to the cab rank saying teh hotel could not allow thier cars to assist. Having waited for 10-15mins for a cab my mother got to hospital. Clearly this did put a dampner on the trip and it took some three months for my mother to fully recover. The rest of the weekend was by comparison uneventful. When it came to our departure and I was paying the bill I noticed that I had been charged for both my Mothers Spa treatments and teh call out charges for the doctor. When I pointed this out the lady admitted that the Spa charges were an error but insisted a doctor had been called and I needed to pay. I pointed out that it was that the floor of the Spa was wet and she should check with teh manager. She did this and he agreed I should not be charged.

This hotel well deserves its reputation as being the number one Hotel of Paris (may be the world) in terms of its luxury and features. Therefore, I will not say more about the Hotel, I am writing this review about the service we got before and during our ceremony. Please note that we live in Canada and we decided to have a destination wedding. At the beginning we didn\u2019t have a clear idea about where we should have our wedding. We first thought of a Caribbean destination and hired a travel agency to organize it for us. We soon realized that although all the hotels provide wedding packages, none of the Hotel guaranteed us privacy (for the ceremony at the beach or gazebo) and special arrangement (at one of their restaurant) since they have to take care of other customers at the same time with their limited capacity. Then, we decided to have it in Paris and we contacted many hotels and restaurants about our inquiry. We received replies from maybe 10% of the venues we contacted, and only one phone call, which was from George V. Romy Zerah, Senior Assistant Catering Manager of George V called us shortly after our sending in our query. She wanted to have a better feeling of our dream wedding and how she could help us make it happen. At the beginning I thought that we would not able to organize our ceremony at this Hotel due to our limited budget. However, after a few phone calls and e-mails; Romy offered us a customized plan which suited all our needs and budget. Romy also took initiative to contact our wedding planner to make sure that the Officiant and Harpist were provided with adequate setting to perform comfortably. On November 10th, we met Pauline Ehrhart, Conference Manager, at the Hotel and she reconfirmed all the details while giving us a tour of the Hotel and the Salon. On the wedding day, Pauline also welcomed us in front of the Hotel and she stayed with us until we left the hotel to make sure that everything went according to plan. As for the ceremony, it was held in the Salon Louis XIII. This room was perfect for us in terms of size as we were a total of 23 people. It had a very impressive interior design and it was beautifully decorated for our event. The room setting was theatrical (two rows with one aisle) for the ceremony; and then later replaced with one long impressive dining table to enjoy champagne and wedding cake. In addition, we noticed so many small but complementary details that added to our event. All the staff involved (from the moment we arrived until we left the hotel) was also exceptionally professional, helpful and friendly. Therefore, I recommend this hotel for its very high standard in providing quality customer service along with its beauty, to everybody especially those who would like to organize their special event in Paris.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat an amazing Hotel for a Romantic Weekend\u201d", "Author": "bdsa", "ReviewID": "UR51689577", "Content": "My husband took me away to Paris for a suprise weekend for our anniversary.

Pros: -great location -great food, the breakfast is awesome, however you need to arrive early if you want to eat breakfast in le cinq, that only happened 3 times in our 10 days. The other areas are sufficient but not quite at the level of le cinq. -great spa and pool- a pool in paris, and it is amazing. I wish I had gone down to the spa earlier in my trip because i could have spent the entire time in that pool. -great concierge in terms of reccomendations and reservations. Never had any problems getting in anywhere, however it was the end of november in a global recession so I'm not sure that we would have had trouble getting into places. -the view from our room is probably the best i've ever stayed in my life. cons: -have to get up early to get into le cinq -costs are pretty crazy, especially with the us dollar being so weak costs are just crazy -i felt more warmth from the front office at four seasons geneva, maybe it's a smaller hotel but I did enjoy that. They were always nice and very professional but it felt more corporate professional type feel and I liked the more intimate feel in geneva, especially they greeted me by name etc. -i did go out of my way to say that i'm going to be there for a long time so i would have thought that over time that would change, but pretty much you can stay 2 nights and 10 nights and the level of service isn't going to change and the level of friendliness of the staff isn't going to change. This could be by design, I'm sure many people would enjoy that. Would I stay there again? I don't know.

The room was excellent. I can not say it was very large considering the price but well designed in high quality materials. Excellent bedding and mattress. The room was a bit on the dark side when we arrived but overall the color palette was charming and suited to the Louis XVII style. The doors opened to the view of the marble courtyard. The bath was all marble with a large soaking tub and separate shower. Very clean. All of the towels, sopas and robes were Bvlgari LVHV.

We did not eat at \"Cinq\" on a recommendation of a close friend who said it was not up to par with the hotel. Fair enough- there are hundreds of great small places to eat right outside. The spa which my wife enjoyed, was again, first class. The pool, located in the spa was clean and always empty. No musty pool odors, rather that of candles.

Breakfast was disappointing on the first morning - our eggs arrived stone cold - sent them back and received fresh ones which were lukewarm. Opted for cold breakfast the following morning and was much better. Snacks in bar perfect! Also had a fabulous cocktail. Overall in the lobby/ bar, the atmosphere was really lovely with musicians and staff all around making sure you were ok but not overbearing. The only complaint in the bar - too small. Our group could not get a seat on the secong evening as many tables were empty but reserved and they would not allow us to sit even though we were leaving in 20 mins. Also used the spa - absolute bliss!! Had a most wonderful massage and then used the sauna/steam room for as long as I wanted. Very relaxing and they provide complimentary fruit juices and fruit.

On complaining to the Manager this was quickly remedied, and though he promised to let me know the outcome of his investigation into the matter the next day, he never did. That said the room was well appointed with a huge bathroom, separate walk in wardrobe and lobby. It also had a small sitting area and desk.

At morning breakfast staff were incredibly attentive to detail without being obtrusive and all seemed to speak perfect English. Interestingly the staff also coped well with Japanese guests and seemed to be able to converse with them in Japanese and offer breakfast menu advice. The flower displays are awesome. I am not really a person who takes much notice of floral displays but these caught even my eye.The arrangements in the dining room were stunning and masterpieces in their own right.

We are not by any stretch multi-millionaires and definitely we like to vacation. However, my wife said its her dream hotel in the world and it was her birthday and our anniversary. So, my review is me walking in with the mindset \"C'mon impress me for 1000 bucks a night\". Damn I was in a dreamland from the moment I stepped to the front desk. At check in they welcomed us with \"Happy Celebration Week\" and you felt you were the VIP guest staying with them that week. After checking in a manager stopped us to give us her business card and told us to let her know if we need anything to call her directly. Very nice touch. We did have to wait about 30 minutes for our room so they invited us for some drinks in the bar area. I need to breakdown all the categories to get through this review. Room: We had a Superior Room and it was beautiful. I don't usually care for the \"old/vintage\" look, but this was amazing. Extremely comfortable with a view of the courtyard which is full of orchids, flowers, and statues. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, tub, and beautiful marble everywhere. They use Bulgari (Vert) high end products and extremely thick towels and robes. They did have a flat screen, which some of the expensive European Rooms usually don't have. They did leave us a bottle of Champagne and Chocolate for our \"Celebration Week\". I of course checked and it was a 120 Euro bottle from Room Service ! That Bed was specatucular and was well appointed. We did ask for an extra blanket which was a whole show in itself (more to come in review) Hotel/Lobby: I was sick of hearing about these flower arrangements, but was totally blown away. It was better then any wedding we could ever attend. Its not just in the lobby as shown on the website, it is thousands of orchids arranged all over the hotel including in your room. The flowers are changed every week and I sw them pouring Evian in the vases (not sure if that was for show or really Evian). The bar and lobby area for drinks is perfection. After 3pm they have a piano player, violinists (certian days) and a 3 piece band other times. You never felt you were at a hotel, but rather a wedding for a high-end family the whole time you stay there. Spa: Small, but well appointed. Locker Rooms have the usual Sauna/Hammam, and nic shower areas. Nothing too spectacular, but for a Urban Spa they had it nicely appointed. Please check out the business center - I thought I accidentally walked into the wrong room it was so beautiful and internet and printing is free there. Also, grab some Evian bottles theres as they are complimentary. I actually had to keep a list of fine details that kept coming and made this the Worlds best Hotel and Service. 1) I put my shoes out for shining (as many hotels do). However, I got them back wrapped in gold foil and paper with shoe horns in them. Are you serious? Amazing detail... 2) DVD List is awesome and complimentary 3) We ran into a manager in the hallway and told her our spa said manicure not pedicure. She whipped out a phone from her back pocket and called immediately in front of us. She said \"anything else\". I was challenging them and she showed me up... 4) We went to Avenues Restaurant down the street and they took us over in the S550 Mercedes for free. Its only 6 blocks, but it was a very nice touch. I recommend that place by the way. 5) At the spa they had a chocolate plate with \"happy anniversary\" on for us when we finished. Nice touch along with the Champagne/Chocolate we got when we checked in. 6) They also have us a \"Happy Anniversary\" Cake as well. Now to my only complaint about the hotel: We never ate at Cinq, but we did eat in the lobby area and bar. The food is barely above average (and actually worse than every place we went to in Paris). Hamburger for 50 Euros I expect it to be amazing and it was terrible. Other reviewers mentioned this, but I'm telling you go eat out and save 80% of the cost. Come back and have drinks and dessert in the hotel and listen to the music. We did have room service breakfast every day that was very good (but you can't screw up waffles and omelets...) Location: It is 2 blocks from Champs Elysees and in the heart of the most beatiful shops, cafes, and casual restaurants. You can find everything within a 5 minute walk. I can't imagine a better location. Its very hard to tell anyone to spend this kind of money on a hotel, but you won't be disappointed. Eat a 5 Euro Panini on the street and stay here. Save all your money to stay here you won't be disappointed. Other Paris hotels are expensive, so why not splurge a little more for the best.

That is no problem at all. We can arrange for a lovely small meeting room, near your suite, that has a fireplace. We can set it up for your stockings and presents!\" My Wife: Shocked and silent amazement... The second anecdote comes from breakfast on the first morning of our stay.

Nothing was too much trouble and we could forget about everything, as we sat in the beautiful pool in the spa, relaxed in the special relaxation room, and munched on fresh fruit and juices constantly topped up by the pool. One of the staff even brought us out evian bottles and a cold refreshing towel as we sat in the hot tub - so thoughtful! The hotel is perfectly situated, 2 minutes from Chance d'lysee and with so many fine restaurants and shops nearby to explore, te location could not be better. The eiffel tower is but a 15 minute walk down to the right of the hotel, and there are excellent views from across the Seine at the bottom of the road down from the hotel.

And that's really saying something. I'm in my early 30s and find that many of the high-end hotels are stuffy and unwelcoming. Not so with the George V which somehow strikes the PERFECT balance between formality and comfort. It has an amazing combination of contemporary floral displays (WOW!) and classical French styling. We were lucky to stay in a large suite, complete with an extremely large wrap-around terrace with outstanding views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur. Perhaps the only drawback was the food, which was perfectly edible but not \u20ac38-for-a-caesar-salad good. I'm not a huge fan of French food so found myself eating a lot at the hotel since I knew, no matter what, it would be up to standard. And it was. It's just that everything else is so much BETTER THAN EXPECTED that the food didn't quite make the grade. Where the George V really shines, however, is the service. Quite simply, it was always perfect. All of the staff always remembered my name. In my opinion, great service is apparently damn-near impossible to deliver. You have to balance between being omnipresent without overbearing, personal without being nosey or too chatty. But yet EVERYONE at the George V did it. Not just occasionally, but EVERY TIME. (Especially Stephanie in the courtyard restaurant!) I can't say enough about this place. I've always loved Paris but this hotel took it to a whole different level. One of the previous reviewers said that the George V can give meaning to life. it's a bold statement but I couldn't agree more strongly.

We received what seemed a generic email in return stating the check-in time of the rooms and requesting us to check in the night before if we wished to have early check in. We were well aware of the check in times - that is why we requested the relatively small favour of an early check in.I thought the generic response was fairly unhelpful - We waited approx 20 minutes to get a seat for a drink in the bar. Again the staff were courteous but still.. - For some reason the waiter took 10 minutes to come to our table in the bar and that was just to give us drinks menus. It took a further 10 minutes for him to return to take our order and a further 10 to receive our druinks. by the time they arrived we needed to leave - For breakfast we were seated at a tiny round table in the bar that was not suited for 2 people asnd was too cramped for 2 for breakfast. We didn't receive any milk with our breakfast and despite trying to get waiter's attention eventually had to go to the bar to request milk for the bar instead - The coffee was cold and we had to request another pot - Check-out took an age - they send you behind to some back room where you queue to get your enormous bill which is a little disssatisfying Just in summary - yes its a fine hotel in a great location and with great rooms.

The bathroom was expansive, with double sinks and ample space to store toiletries. We had room service one night and despite the 5* expense, was delightful.

The bathroom was beautifully appointed with 2 basins, a short but wide bath and a separate double shower with Bulgari products.

Champagne and sweets were in our room on arrival, which was fantastic after a 30 hour journey. The room overlooked a courtyard (not the marble courtyard) and we could see the top portion of the Eiffel tower, which sparkled at night on the hour from 9pm. Hotel staff was courteous, always smiling and enthusiastic. We booked a hotel transfer from the airport (285 euro) which included an airport escot who met us on exit from the aeroplane and accompanied us through customs via the priority lane. That was nice but we travelled business class and were given passes through the priority lanes anyway. Also, landing at 6am meant that customs was practically empty and we would have got through quickly with or without the escot. The airport escot may be of better value if your plane lands during peak times of the day. I didn't know whether there would have been long queues for taxis at the airport either. A black BMW was waiting for us. You can weigh up the pros and cons for the airport transfer. Our taxi fare from the hotel to airport was 50 euro. We didn't have any breakfasts at the hotel (upwards of 40 euro per person) but each morning we had breakfast on one of the cafes on Champs. Would highly recommend the Drugstore brassary at the top (just before the arch). Great (!!!) coffee and continental breakfast sets for 8-16 euro. We did have coffee at the hotel while waiting for our room. Cost 12 euro each and were weak American style (brown flavoured hot water). Le Cinq restaurant was quite an experience. The waiters were wonderful and attentive. The food was nice and delicately presented. The price was far more than what I have ever imagined a dinner for two could be, but I think it is great to have experienced it. The location is great for a romantic getaway. It is 5 minutes walk from the arch and a leisurely stroll from the Eiffel tower. We had dinner at Cafe de l'homme with a full view of the Eiffel tower, which was recommended to us by the hotel concierge. It was such an incredible sight that the thought still brings tears to my eyes. Make sure you book 8:30pm or later so you can see the sparkling Eiffel tower. Metro is right at the junction of rue George V and Champs. Once you are on the metro, you can go everywhere, but beware pick-pockets. The hotel was recently renovated (year 2000 I think). There was a book in our room on the history of the hotel, which was well worth a read. All the furniture in our room was new but in the traditional French style. It would be a disappointment for people who are looking for the authentic olden days French hotel. The clean, new, reproduction furniture suited us just fine. Having stayed at 400 euro Paris hotels little larger than a shoebox, we thought our room was quite good value. Some of the other reviewers in Premier rooms for significantly more seem to be somewhat disappointed, so maybe deluxe is the way to go? (unless you are more in the budget bracket for a suite) We also used the pool and gym in the evenings after sightseeing. The jacuzzi did wonders for my aching feet.

I had read so many great reviews of the hotel, that maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment!! I was looking for the ultimate Paris hotel experience, but I'm not sure if I got it. I would definitely stay here again, but my next time in Paris, I might very well try something else. One of the high points of the hotel is its staff. They were generally really helpful and attempted to please. An example of this was the front desk manager. We had booked the top class of double room - the Premier (I think) at about $1500 per night. I was somewhat disappointed as this room was not even located in the hotel, but in adjoining building, connected to the hotel by a long hallway. I didn't feel that the room had a lot of character to it. It was perfectly nice, but just not really special. I had stayed in the George V prior to it becoming a Four Seasons, and the room we had then had amazing decor, so the Four Seasons corportate look is a bit of a let-down. The front desk manager worked with us over several days to find a better room. Eventually we moved to a superior suite, which was an improvement, and located in the main hotel...although I still felt the decor was a bit lacking, and the suite only had one window for three rooms. Still, I appreciated the effort involved by the front desk manager, and he was a very nice guy. We had similar pleasing experiences with the concierge and the luggage porters. The gym is very nice and very well-equipped in quite a small space. There are two or three elliptical machines, three or four treadmills, and a rowing machine, as well as lots of weight machines and free weights. There are nicely chilled waters and cold scented towels which were very refreshing -- I loved the frangrance of the towels. The pool is nice, but very small, although in Paris, it is a surprise to have a pool at all. The location of the hotel is great, but I do agree with one of the other reviews that the Champs Elysees location is not my favorite. It has improved, I think over the years, and we ate at a number of the restaurants on the boulevard. We especially loved Laduree for breakfast, and Leon, for a great Belgian mussel dinner experience. With the euro exchange rate being what it was during our visit, I did feel that the hotel breakfast was quite highly priced and not worth it. I have stayed at a number of Four Seasons hotels, and I would rank the ones in Istanbul and Tokyo above this one, even though the Paris hotel is very good. Istanbul just had a lot more character -- for instance, canapes were delivered to our room in Istanbul every afternoon. It was wonderful, and the general decor of the rooms was better in my opinion. In Tokyo , the number of amenities in the room was unbelievable -- think combs, brushes, face blotting papers, pajamas, and elastic bands for your hair, and again, I thought the modern decor was memorable. Both the Istanbul and Tokyo properties have such a special flair about them. Apart from Four Seasons hotels, I would also rank a number of properties in Asia over this one....for instance, Raffles in Singapore, the Oriental in Bangkok, and even the Peninsula in Hong Kong deliver a better experience.

Rather than tell me, he actually led me there and then opened the door for me to go in. Another time, as I was coming out of a lift with a bag, a member of the hotel staff came up immediately to carry it for me. Our table at dinner was covered with rose petals as it was our birthday. The waiter brought a little footstool for my handbag. Tiny details but the staff make you feel so special and looked after.

I know we can't be gaurenteed upgrades with that quality all the time -- but hey if it only happens once and this is it -- it was so worth it!! We also received free breakfast each morning and a $50 food credit.

The Galerie bar and restaurant, where we got a tea time and a dinner with live music playing (fantastic experience, strongly recommended) is splendid. I suggest to spend some time into the SPA. It is beautiful with relax area, a good swimming pool with a Jacuzzi tub. The staff pampers you with a lot attentions. They bring you mineral water, and cool washcloth for refreshing your face. Free tea, infusion, and fruit available. But the best has been my birthday dinner at Le Cinq restaurant (2 stars Michelin guide). They booked for us the best table of the restaurant. They have been able to surprise me and to make this day really a special day. Just to give an example, in the middle of the meal a person of the staff asked us to take a picture. Few minutes later they gave to me a nice greetings card with our picture printed inside as a souvenir. I found this fantastic. All the hotel staff work very hard to remember your name and make you feel special. One recommendation: choose the bed and breakfast package; even if there is no buffet, the food is good with nice presentation and you can choose between different breakfasts: French, Continental, American, Japanese, without addition. Only two marginal remarks. First: we stayed in George V in March and in that moment there were works going on for a partial restoring, overshadowing the beauty of the Marble Courtyard (garden of the hotel, were in summer is possible to eat). But the nice interiors and the staff\u2019s attentions brings you to forget about this inconvenient. Second: in the second day when we came back at 4 p.m. the room was not yet made. We had to wait up to 5 p.m. at the bar. We reported the problem but nothing happened. Final comment: the price is very high, but to be honest its worth every penny of it. The George V for us have been beyond all expectations. Maybe the best service we have experimented up to now.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cIt dosent get much better\u201d", "Author": "deanstevens", "ReviewID": "UR14374151", "Content": "Wow this really was something special It has location , style , class , luxury andanything else you could possibly wt from a hotel all rolled into one The bedrooms and public areas are spotless and well decorated The main thing is the staff they are potentially the best trained staff in europe if not the world This place is a must", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cFour Seasons George V\u201d", "Author": "budgee", "ReviewID": "UR14349027", "Content": "I decided to surprise my mom and take her to Paris before Christmas to do some shopping, having fun, and get in the holiday-mood.

Location is good, flower decorations just amazing, rooms grandious (a bit funny though, there are lots of prisms and drops missing from the chrystal chandeliers - i guess memorablia for previous guests...), but thats all. Upon arrival our taxi could not take us to the entrance as drive-way was full with cars. We got out on the street, pulled out luggage from trunk while 4 personell was watching us at the entrance - no one helped us, even not, when going towards the entrance!! One just let us in, did not ask if we need help... After check-in, the guy came out from behind the desk, took the luggage from my mom and asked me if i dont mind bringing my luggage myself... What a service... :( We usually got out of the room around 9 am and got back around 4-5 pm. One day when we entered the room after 4pm we just realized a made is just working in our room - there was no sign outside! As we were very tired, I asked her just to do the beds and leave us, she did not understand it in English, had to call Housekeeping to ask them to translate what I need. Even after that she did not do it, just simply started to vacuum clean - whilst we were already in the room and asked her to leave! There were no appoligies later, nothing at all, it was like nothing happened. I tried to use the swimming pool one evening, but I had to leave after 15 min or so as it was full with kids (at least 6), jumping in the water, and being so loud like hell, nobody from staff asked them or the parents to stop this.

Instead, grand rooms with fresh powder blue and elegant trim, high ceilings, impeccable bathrooms, plush towels, Bulgari bath accessories and a wonderfully well stocked minibar.

I spent Christmas here with my mother (we chose Paris as she lives in France and I live in the UK) and overall it was a lovely experience. We booked the Six Senses Package for 3 nights which turned out to be very good value (Superior room, daily breakfast, 3 course dinner at La Galerie each evening and a one-hour daily spa treatment each). It was no more expensive to stay there over Christmas than at any other time of year it seemed which was refreshing given the cost of top UK hotels during the festive period. The room was beautiful and spacious. Only one vanity unit in the bathroom but a separate bath and shower so plenty of space there too. Bulgari toiletries and pretty much every amenity that you can think of (except a coffee maker which you rarely seem to get in top hotels these days). Good entertainment system but very limited choice of DVDs and our dealings with the Business Center on this front were a bit hit and miss. Housekeeping was a different story - it operated like clockwork and the room was turned around very quickly each day and was always fully serviced when we returned from breakfast. Breakfast in Le Cinq was wonderful, the spa was lovely (good therapists, complimentary herbal teas, coffee and fruit, although arrive in your robe as the locker room is small), and the staff at the hotel work very hard to remember your name and make you feel special. Dinner at La Galerie was ok, but I wouldn't have eaten there more than once if dinner hadn't been included in our package (the food was very pricey for what it was - approx. 275Euros for a 3 course meal for 2 people without wine - and it's less of a restaurant, more of a corridor lounge, with very low uncomfortable chairs). It was also cold in La Galerie every evening due to the draughts coming through the courtyard doors. Having said that, they had live music every night (different types so we never got bored) and it had a nice atmosphere. We also had afternoon tea in La Galerie one afternoon and that was suprisingly reasonable. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas and overall it was a lovely stay. The staff and the decor make it feel special rather than the facilities or the dining in my opinion. However, I stayed at the Peninsula in Hong Kong earlier in the year and enjoyed that more. We had one issue on checkout. To begin with I was presented with a bill for the package plus all of the included items as additional charges. I asked for these to be removed and the mistake was quickly rectified, although I was informed that dinner in La Galerie was only included up to the value of 80 Euros per person. I told the cashier that this was not reflected on the website, the booking confirmation, or on pre-arrival correspondence and that we had even checked in person with reception on our arrival and had not been informed of the limit then either. The cashier insisted on charging me for dinner each evening over and above the 80 Euros per person and I decided not to argue. However, my mother had a different view and took this up with reception before our departure. They discovered that the French version of the website and package clearly states the 80 Euro limit, but the English version does not. This is something to be aware of if you are booked on the Six Senses package. Reception agreed to request a refund to my card but could not do it there and then for some reason. However, the additional amount was refunded to my card and a credit receipt sent to my home address within a few days of departure.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cTreat Yourself.... you deserve it!\u201d", "Author": "Gingersheep", "ReviewID": "UR12332464", "Content": "Loved the George V.

If you want to truly dine like royalty, and don't mind spending quite a bit of money on dinner, try Alain Ducasse (not in the hotel). Georges V offered us the hotel's private car, which took us to dinner on our first night there. The hotel also coordinated a car and driver for us so we could take in all the sites of Paris at night.

There were, however, some strange inconsistencies with the service which, although not horrible, did detract from an otherwise fabulous experience. For example, when I booked our reservation for 2 rooms, I asked for rooms which were either connecting or close to eachother. Upon check-in, I was told that only one room was ready and that we should check back later for our other room. An hour later, we received a message from the front desk advising that there was a second room ready three floors below or we could wait for a room on our floor. We elected to wait. I requested to see the other room, which was lovely, but not that close to our other room. Although at 3:00 p.m. were were told that the second room would be ready shortly, it took until close to 6:00 p.m. (with a number of calls by me) before we actually received the key to the second room. Even when the key was brought, no one seemed concerned by or apologetic for the delay. Also, I had requested information from the concierge regarding a restaurant (Laserre). I was told that the information would be sent to my room, but I never received anything from the concierge. Three out of four mornings our breakfast (which was included as part of the American Express Fine Hotels Program) at Le Cinq was fantastic. The last morning, it seemed like someone lost our order, as the three of us all received our meals at different times and we waited an exceptionally long time for my husband to finally receive a waffle. Despite these odd glitches, I still found the overall experience to be excellent and I would definitely return to this hotel.

While we were visiting at a very busy time we never felt the service suffered.

Traveling with a weary child we opted for the upgrade. While waiting for our room, we had breakfast in the terrace room.

We consulted the Concierge about directions and attractions and they were always helpful and on target. When we were going to walk to the D'Orsey the concierge advised a cab since it was closing soon. We were given the option of a car to Versailles, but the Concierge suggested the short walk to the RER train at Port Alma would be less expensive and very easy. It was. I highly recommend the Museum Pass. It is available at the gift shop. The pass allows you to use a separate entrance and avoid the crowds at most attractions. While I had read on this site that we would have to wait in line for ticket for our child anyway so the pass wasn't a time saver, I only found this to be the case Les Invalides. And there wasn't a line anyway. The staff at the Four Seasons handled our dinner reservations and we were treated very well at the restaurants. I really appreciated this after inquiring at a subsequent Paris hotel about a restaurant and the staff opened the back door and pointed. Later it turned out it was closed. Stay at the Four Season!!!

Nonetheless, we were personally greeted by the new hotel director and escorted up to our room, which had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower. There were champagne and chocolates waiting for us, but no rose petal covered bed, candles, or other fancy tricks done by other top hotels for honeymooners. This too was slightly disappointing.

Spending a girls' weekend in Paris in the spring at the George V is a truly magical experience. We arrived in the morning (overnight flight from New York) and were warmly greeted by the staff. We were informed that our room was not quite ready, but that the bellman would be delighted to bring our bags to the gorgeous spa so that we could take showers, have a light bite to eat, enjoy the quiet room, have a swim, sauna or steam, and just generally relax and recharge. Ahh.... We enjoyed some spa time, showered and headed out for a lovely lunch in St. Germain. Upon our return to the hotel--where the unbelievable lobby flowers from the morning had been freshened up by even more unreal arrangements--we learned that our room was ready and naturally our bags were already in our room. Ahh... Our room was on the fifth floor with a gorgeous view of the gardens and Avenue George V. It was spacious and comfortable with an enormous bathroom. The closets were large with lots of hangers and there was plenty of drawer space--little details that many hotels seem to be forgetting about these days. The decor reminded us of a little girl's dream Princess Room. Lovely, warm yellows and soft creams. The room was ornate but not overdone. A crystal chandelier glistened in the sun-filled space. The beds were the perfect combination of firm and soft, warm and cool. And the towels and robes were exactly what you expect when you go to a Four Seasons. The usual Bulgari treats were plentiful. Our chambermaid was exceptionally thoughtful. She arranged my shoes in the closet, and thoughtfully closed and arranged all of my bath products I'd carelessly left unsealed. We had breakfast in our room as the sun shone in and the breeze blew by. The best croissants, juice and jellies I have ever tasted. And the coffee was divine. I began to wonder...were they drugging me with laughing gas through the vents? We did not eat in the restaurant, but enjoyed drinks in the bar. Though small and crowded one evening (wedding revelers took up a good part of the bar), the space is ruby red and rather imposing but warm and welcoming with a lovely staff and a truly memorable Sancerre. The concierge service, as at every Four Seasons I've visited, was phenomenal. The staff--truly exceptional in every way. It's an expensive spot no matter how you slice it, but the slice is heavenly.

It's certainly one of the nicest hotels I have ever seen. The physical environment is impressive. Gorgeous lobby in marble and luxury finishings. The flowers in the hotel lobby and restaurants alone must cost them thousands per day. The room was large by Paris standards, with a walk-in closet, large, lovely bathroom, and the bedroom was decorated beautifully with the most tasteful, lovely decor imaginable. We were in a back courtyard with trees, so the view was not special, but it was also very quiet. The location is superb. Near the Champs-Elysees and great shopping. Convenient to 2 Metro stations. They were always able to get us taxis, which is sometimes a problem in Paris. The service is over-the-top, typical for a Four Seasons. We only had breakfast in the restaurant, although they are supposed to be one of the best dining experiences in Paris. Thank goodness we had a special deal which included breakfast because otherwise it was 35 Euros per person for a continental breakfast! We did not have time to check out the spa/exercise facilities, although I'm sure they were great. The concierges handled all our requests very competently. They seemd to be busy 24/7 with their high maintenance guests. The guests themselves were quite the well-heeled sort, well-dressed, good-looking, wealthy types, etc. That may or may not suit you. And that brings me to my last point. If money is no object, why would you not stay at this hotel? However, if you either care about your wallet, or feel that it's important to get ultimate value for your dollar (or euro), you may ask yourself whether it's really necessary to spend this kind of money for a hotel room in Paris. Most tourists who come here are probably busy vsiting museums, sites, shopping, and doing all the things that Paris has to offer. So, like New York, how much time are you actually spending in the hotel anyway? Furthermore, there are really a lot of other choices in Paris Hotels where you can have a very nice experience for half the cost. So, ultimately, although this was a once in a lifetime experience, I would stay somewhere else next time I am in Paris.

I stayed at the super-luxurious Four Seasons George V Hotel. This place simply oozes luxury - our basic (if you can call it basic!) twin room was extremely comfortable and spacious, with a huge marble bathroom, a small lounge area and a mini bar which was more like an entire store! The hotel lounge is sumptuous - take afternoon tea with cakes from the trolley, the cakes look like jewels and taste of heaven - and the atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly. The bar is fantastic - quite masculine but very cosy and comfortable. The restaurant is extremely beautiful - very formal but not stuffy; the food was super-rich and beautifully cooked and presented - it's not to my taste but if you like the Michelin 3-star style you'll love it, although maybe not the prices: some main courses were 250 euros each. I know you wouldn't usually think about flower displays when considering which hotel to stay in but at the George V they're an art form. They ship in 15000 blooms a week and have a team of florists refreshing vases on an hourly basis - nothing's done half-heartedly at the George V. The best thing about the hotel though is the staff - they are welcoming, friendly and unstuffy, but the service is superb and they are not over-familiar or intrusive; for me they made the hotel. I'm not loaded and this was a special treat, but despite the hotel being stuffed to the gills with the uber-rich, I never felt uncomfortable or out of place. If I had one critiscm it's that this fabulous hotel is very, very popular with the very rich and corporates so it was very busy - a couple of times we couldn't get a seat in the lounge or bar - of course the staff soon sorted that out for us.

There was a hallway leading to the main living room/dining room area. There were two little balconies from which you could see beautiful roofs of Paris apartments. The kitchen was hidden behind two closed doors and contained a nearly full-size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave and oven. The downstairs also contained a coat closet and a nice size bathroom. A staircase led us up to the bedroom with its extremely comfortable bed, and small sitting room. The sitting room had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was magnificent! The bathroom was all marble and glass with a separate tub that was so deep, you could almost swim in it! Back downstairs, waiting on the glass coffee table was a bottle of champagne and a beautiful pastry/cream dessert that said \"Happy Anniversary\". It was definitely the most beautiful room we have ever stayed in. During our stay, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

It is a rarity to see a Hotel Director out of their office, but at the George V the Director is a \"hands on\" manager. Jean-Claude Wetzel even checked my bags as I prepared for a late departure. A friend who was in our traveling party required medical assistance and before you could turn around, paramedics from the hotel arrived. A car and driver was provided immediately for an appointment with a quality physician at a Paris hospital. Fortunately, everything turned out well. The hotel's on-site Spa is highly professional, exceptionally clean, and customer friendly. Regarding food, the morning croissants were spectacular! The George V is in a superb location just a couple of blocks from the Champs and a five-minute walk from the Arc de Triumph. In my judgment, George V has earned Trip Advisor's #1 ranking in Paris.

And indeed, the luxury of the dining room is impressive and grand, although the first grain of doubt, that is good taste yielding to knock-out ostentation, creeps insidiously at the first steps walking to the table. The next astonishment, swallowed silently , came with the welcoming starter arrival - how was it possible in a three-star Parisian establishment to serve proscuitto with absolutely no invention \u2013 just plain good old proscuitto on the plate? We were not in Italian trattoria\u2026That was a bit shocking, and ominous - the quality of the restaurant can ALWAYS be judged by this chef's treat before anything else arrives. It is the same in purpose as the first dazzling aria in an opera, made up to hold one\u2019s breath, to astonish, to set up the mood for the remainder of the performance. Le Cinq was a perfect example of the rule, unfortunately. After such a starter, the proudly announced duck, advertised as having been cooked for 24 hours, revealed its best kep secret of being just a chewy sweet overcooked piece of protein, accompanied with Chinese style green beans, suspiciously reminding of the taste of China town in any major American city. Dessert was just as mediocre, and it was funny how pompous everything was described by the staff, with their eyes rolling in ecstasy, only to end up so bland and plain on the plate. Indeed the service was the best ingredient of the dinner, persuasive and even hypnotic - waiters were speaking so solemnly, with awe and reverence about the dishes. And then, after the sobering tastelessness of the first bite it was only too painful to feel the inability to join them in their near-religious worship of this eclectic edible food. One explanation may be that they never try Le Cinq food themselves because it\u2019s so exorbitantly expensive that the management prohibits even the chef to taste a spoon or two? It is sad to see how the desire to be different and extravagant exterminated the bottom-line - serving fine French cuisine to delight all senses. Le Cinq must be so hype and in vogue due to the prestige they managed to create, and perhaps the diners simply don't dare to admit how poor the food is after paying a fortune for an evening of a surrealistic gastronomic discovery. And one last note \u2013 the d\u00e9cor and flowers in the clear vases must be Four Seasons signature, as in Cairo or in Boston the decorations are very similar.

We lost a scarf in the bar, and the staff was too troubled to be asked to locate it. But they did try...Mind you, we are native Parisian French speakers. (So that goes to show rudeness is democratic in Paris, not just towards Americans!!!) What we also find disturbing - and sad - is the fact that the George V is now generically referred to as the Four Seasons, with the historic \"George V\" namesake lost somewhere in translation. What a shame! It was an American who initially created this hotel for the Anglophone client\u00e8le, and named it in honor of George V. It is interesting to note that it is the International customers who always refer to it as the George V, while the American guests always call it the Four Seasons, not always aware of the hotel's significant historic American connection (General Eisenhower established headquarter here at the end of World War II), or the fact that Four Seasons is a Canadian chain. And after staying here for a while, the hotel does seem like another generic expensive venue for some people to play out their fantasy of wealth and power, and the atmosphere quickly ceases to be classy. We highly recommend this hotel for a general opulent stay, but beyond that, there are other hotels with more characters, and more histories. In addition, we much prefer the nuancely aristocratic, the discretely restrained, and the slightly stand-offish but acommodating service of the many other Parisian H\u00f4tel-Palaces.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cA great location\u201d", "Author": "annalef", "ReviewID": "UR4233106", "Content": "It was a pleasure staying at this hotel.

During our stay we had a deluxe room on the 7th floor with the Eiffel Tower View. We also had twice dinner at the hotel's elegant dressed in grey and gold restaurant Le Cinq. The food is exceptional and the waiters very, very frendly. To be honest the staff here are more friendly than in the Ritz's Espandon restaurant. We also had two Spa treatments each which we have found to be very good. The swimming pool is smaller than the Ritz's hotel but it is also very very nice and luxurious.

We chose this hotel to be our honeymoon hotel and could not have found a better place! They say it's expensive, and sure that's true. But the value you get for your money here is unbeatable, in my opinion. The minute you walk in to the lobby, you are treated like a princess (or a prince for that matter) no matter who you are or what you want. The receptionists actually knew our names and our special requests, and they made us feel like they have been eagerly awaiting us to visit, without being too familiar. We ordered a deluxe room, and we weren't upgraded. Now, I do realize that a lot of people get offended by not getting a free upgrade when on a honeymoon. But with these rooms, you really can't be either disappointed or offended! They are so oversized and perfect - it's ridiculous. The decor is so stunning and perfect and the quality of the interior is amazing. The double door bathroom was more than perfect with a walk-in shower that easily took 3 people :), a bath tub, a large and beautiful sink and a separate toilet area. The products you get are BVLGARI. What a treat! Needless to say, we brought them with us. The bed and pillows were splendid. We slept like babies. The whole hotel is so well thought trough and the mix of super wealthy and famous people mixed with normal people, is lovely. You have stylish people mixed with no taste people with money. People watching is fun! You can wear casual chic or go for an advanced cocktail dress with some serious diamond accessories, and you'd fit right in. Do what ever you feel like. I wore a cocktail dress a couple of nights, when we had a drink in the bar before going out to dinner. I felt down right gorgeous. The bar-area with piano entertainment was one of our favorites, relaxing, great drinks, coffee and excellent service. The concierge-service was absolutely brilliant, use them! They are such professionals. We had one of our dinners at restaurant \"Lasserre\" and how amazing it was! I recommend you to take the hotel limousine, it cost a little, but oh such luxury. When you arrive to the restaurant, you feel like you are invited to a mystery club that no one else know of. Two sad looking doors opens magically by 4 people, and you are immediately escorted in to a little secret elevator, covered with dark red velvet, floor to roof, and a bell boy. You go up one level, and when the tiny elevator door opens, you step right in to this magical and decadent restaurant. Brilliant! Go there if you can. It has 2 stars in the M-guide. Restaurant Le Cinq was fully booked all nights of our visit, we had chosen not to make reservations in advance. (you never know what you feel for, once there-theory) but we ate breakfast there every morning!. It is so beautiful in the restaurant and so exquisite. When you are seated, they serve you a freshly made tiny Cr\u00e8me Brule as a pre-starter. IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD. If you get the right waitress or maitre'd, they actually give you a little chair for the news paper to rest on while you eat. Cute! The pool area and SPA is so incredible, we never wanted to leave. They have people that individually escort you around the area so you know where everything is, the first time you visit. Complementary everything, Evian bottles, tea, juices of all sorts, fruits, XXXXL towels and more. The area itself is so relaxing and beautiful! We took a massage one day, and returned to the pool area, for a swim every day. It was so relaxing to sit in our robes, drinking something good and fresh, small talking with each other. We just enjoyed the moment down there. The locker rooms were extravagant. We ran out like kids in a candy store, to tell each other of how the locker rooms were equipped. You get complementary toothbrush and shaving kits, your own Dermalogica facial products, Redken hair products and as many robes and slippers as you could ever need. I think the key to enjoying anything is to turn down the tempo. Since we've been to Paris several times, we just went for strolls along the Seine and visited cute cafes. But if it's your first time, and you are living at George V \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t visit more than one sightseeing thing per day, to keep your sanity. The Eiffel Tower is mandatory, and so is Le Louvre. The other things can wait. Enjoy yourselves at the hotel instead.

On check out I found that a bar bill of 350 euros had been added to my account that was not mine. This was very quickly resolved, however the cashier did advise that mistakes can happen however those less honest sometimes give the wrong details to avoid payment. So always check your bill.

The girl taking the booking replied that she would, on this occasion, upgrade us, which was much appreciated. I don't agree that the friendliness of the staff is either forced or fake; they are handpicked for their social skills as well as their professional excellence and we all prefer to be treated with courtesy and true manners.

It has been well documented in other reviews how good the food is, so take heed of this for it is all true. We had the tasting menu at E210 pp which had many courses, but it is nouvelle cuisine so the actual amount of food you eat isn't enormous. Due to the richness of the dishes you do feel full after the meal, and delicious and different breads are offered throughout your dining. If I have to be negative about anything, then it would be the cost......of course we are all in different financial positions, but even for someone fabulously wealthy, their eyes must water when they are taken to the special room where you pay your bill. You will haemorrhage money from the moment you arrive and when you see the prices of the mini bar you will get a good idea what to expect for the duration of your stay. Also, you must tip in Paris - everyone! And if you have just payed over E100 to have your hair done, E5 will not suffice!
