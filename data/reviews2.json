I hesitated to check my purse, but was assured the area was secure. However, when we picked them up, I checked my wallet and discovered that all of my cash was missing. As we had charged everything to the room, I did not use any cash, and my purse was either in the room, or with the front desk. When I reported the missing cash, all four people at the desk looked at me like I had three heads, and only stated that the room has a code an no one could get in. Of course, this leads me to believe it was someone there. My friend asked if we could at least complete some type of report, and no one knew what to do. 20 minutes later, they found a report and took my information, but did not complete it. They gave me a supervisor's card, who I contacted my email, but never recieved a response.

My husband replied that it ought to be ready since it was nearly midnight. When we stepped into the seedy lobby we were told that they had overbooked and would \"walk\" us to a reciprocal hotel down the strip. We declined and located our own alternate hotel. The 10 minutes we spent in the Shores' lobby were unimpressive - I only recognize 2 of the photos on the website. There may be a stunning lobby just around the corner, but it was not the area we stood in listening to sirens on the strip surrounded by what looked like old living room furniture.

It is not the luxury beach resort I expected, but it is a lovely property. I was in an ocean view room with balcony, and it was well-appointed. I had no issues that other reviewers have complained about re: cleanliness, my room was fine. The bed was comfortable, the linens were nice, and the room was a nice size. The robe was a nice touch, and perfect for watching the sun rise from my balcony. The room rate was incredibly reasonable, (not much more than the Marriotts by the airport and speedway), perhaps because it's the off-season. I was there on a Thursday night and the happy hour in the lobby was lovely. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant (delicious, and not overpriced) and danced to the live music in the bar afterward. As to those expressing dismay with the resort fee, I've found those things to be standard at most beach resorts and $20 a day is not bad to me. I've been at Marriott Renaissance properties where they were 20% of the room rate. However, I did think that $30 for chairs and an umbrella on the beach is steep given that they do charge this resort fee. I did have some issues with getting copies of my bill-they had my e-mail address incorrectly, and even when it was corrected, I still never got it. Also, it's kind of frustrating that even when you are on the property, you have to call their reservations line to make any changes, and the line is not open 24/7. However, in my mind these are minor issues and are just what you get when you deal with a smaller independent hotel as opposed to a national chain brand.

It is very difficult to stay here unless you have a car because it is far away from everything. The do have free parking across the street from the hotel which is a plus. Apart from the on-site restaurant, there is really no place you can walk to and get a good meal. The breakfast at the restaurant is excellent whether you have the buffet or order from the a-la-carte menu. The French Toast with a Peach Compote is the best I have ever had. We had a balcony room on the 10th floor w/a view of the beach that was very nice. We enjoyed having the balcony in the early mornings as well as the early evenings. The staff is always polite and helpful. Our bathroom was tiny but clean and great water pressure in the shower. The pool is a bit small for the number of people that sit around it and swim in it. It was constantly filled with screaming kids so your best bet is to go to the beach for some quiet time. *Beware*, you are not allowed to take the pool towels to the beach; so you must bring your own beach towels to this hotel which is a problem if you are trying to travel with just a carry-on bag. Daytona Beach allows cars to park on the beach all day; so people drive their personal cars onto the beach and park in front of the hotel on the sand. The hotel does not have beach umbrellas or beach chairs. You can rent them privately in the beach in front of the hotel for 30 USD per day for two chairs and one umbrella. At night they have gas fire pits surrrounded by Adirondack chairs where you can relax or roast marshmallows.

Now im not mean, but with the hotel room costing the best part of $300 per day, you would have thought parking was free. Also, after getting married the following morning, we wanted to celebrate with a couple of bottles of champagne which we had bought ourselves, and have their breakfast buffet in their restaurant which was $15 per head, when we opened the champagne, they told us they have to charge us a \"corkage charge\" of $20 per bottle, which under the circumstances, was a bit harsh to say the least! We had dinner on the Saturday evening in their restaurant, and we both ordered the steak. After finishing the starters, we had to wait the best part of 40 minutes for our main course, which was strange because the place wasn't busy, and when we enquired what was going on, they tried to make out they were late because i had ordered my steak well-done!

This is sort of typical of the organization of this hotel. We arrived for a work conference in July. As you pull in the covered entry way is chaotic. We headed in to check in and they asked for my keys even though we were not using valet. We tried to check in at 2 but the room was not ready but they did pre check us and said they would call us.........they never did. We finally got into the rooms whcih are nice but need a little attention to detail. The window was open and we were not able to close it and had to call maintenance. The air was not on and the room was extremely hot. The two biggest problems with the room is that the drain in the shower takes forever to drain and you are standing in about 5 inches of water as you shower. The second thing is that the tv is offset from the canopy bed. if you try and watch tv from the bed the post is in the middle of the tv. this hotel was possibly the loudest hotel i have ever stayed in. Doors slam all day and night. The rooms have an outer door that lead to the inner door so you get to hear both doors slam...next to you, across from you and above you. No rest in four days. The room service is good and fast. The staff is a mixed bag. Some are great and others could care less. The location is nice. If you want a poolside chair.....good luck. If you self park you must park across the street and enter a code to enter. Apparently they change the code on Mondays but do you think they tell the guests...........no.....good thing for cell phones because they do not answer the intercom from the parking lot.

Everyone on the staff was super friendly. Our room wasn't quite ready when we got there at 1pm but that was OK. We went out to lunch and it was ready when we got back. We got a King size oceanfront room with a pull-out sleeper sofa. The King bed was wonderfully comfy with several fluffy pillows. The sofa bed slept good...wasn't the best, but hey, it's a sofa sleeper. The view was absolutely amazing. The balcony was spacious and had a round table and two chairs. The only complaint about the room was that the in-room fridge was filled with stuff. We had brought some waters and Gatorades to put in the fridge and it was hard to find room. They want you to drink the stuff provided. A can of soda was $2.50 plus 18% service charge. It seemed ridiculous at the time but we ended up drinking 5 of them. It was cheaper than the bar and the beach vendors. I don't mind them charging more for the drinks but I was hoping for more room in the fridge to store our stuff. I guess we could have taken some of their stuff out. But, we didn't. This is my only complaint...and it's only a little complaint. My husband ate conch at the tiki bar outside and he said it was wonderful. Other than that and some beers and sodas, we did not eat or drink at their restaurant. The pool was nice, clean and warm. It wasn't that big though. There were plenty of lounge chairs around the pool. The pool went from 3 (or 3.5) feet to 8.5 feet deep. There was a hot tub and a little kiddie pool but I didn't use them. There are 3 fire pits outside where we could fire up some marshmallows (extra cost) in the evening. This seemed like a nice touch but we didn't do it. There is a beach vendor right outside the hotel on the beach that rents umbrellas and lounge chairs. We got one huge umbrella, small square table and two lounge chairs for $30 for the whole day (they close up at 5pm). This was wonderful. They also sell boogie boards and other water \"toys\". The boogie boards were $10 for the day. Great price for the enjoyment. There were 4 elevators and they all were quick. No complaints there. We never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator (we were on the 6th floor). You could have your car valet parked for $xx per day but they have a parking lot directly across the street for us to use. You park there and then walk across this cool, covered walkway that goes over the road. It was pretty neat and convenient. The parking lot was well lit and though it wasn't secured, you did have to have an access code to get in. Access to the beach was easy. There are about 14 steps down a staircase from the pool area and you are right on the beach. This is 'gated' and you need a code to get back in...though during the day the gate was never locked due to the activity of people coming and going. Overall, it was an excellent trip. I did a lot of research before booking this hotel. So many of the Daytona hotels are old and I've heard there are 'seedier' places. But, this one was AWESOME. Very well updated and fancy, IMO.

I travel often for business and have had difficulty in the past finding a decent option in Daytona as everything seems very worn and outdated. I finally stumbled upon this hotel almost by mistake and I'm glad I did. What a breath of fresh air this place is! There was a good mix of business travelers and families staying for vacation. The Shores manages to cater to both quite effectively. After staying here two nights, I am baffled at its trip advisor ranking, definitely the best option in Daytona in my opinion. The surrounding area is quiet and less congested than the main Daytona Beach area just a few miles north. The beach area is nice, adequate pool and hot tub with a nice tiki bar. There is an upscale restaurant or the option to eat at the tiki bar (which is more like sandwiches/burgers, etc.). I ate both nights at the tiki bar and was pleasantly surprised each time. The bartender Lori has been there 9 years and seems to be well known/well liked by all. Some of the prior negative reviews are really misplaced. The pics of the bed are unfair...the frames have an artistic red coloring which a prior reviewer tried to make look like the bed was dirty or something. The hotel staff could not be more friendly. Lori is fun to talk to and the front desk manager, Jennifer, helped me out of a major scheduling jam with Expedia that was completely my fault. I didn't find any charges excessive or unreasonable. The Rooms are spacious, clean, and best I,ve encountered in Daytona. Each rom has a bag of marshmallows that you can take downstairs to roast in front of a fire pit which I thought was really unique.

It was ok, but I feel it was overpriced for what you get and the service you receive. I would look at other hotels before returning if I wanted to go to Daytona for the same type of event again. Arrival/Parking - A bit chaotic, was told it was $16 for valet (I had previously been told $10 prior to arrival). I chose to self park across the street. Room - We were in an Executive Ocean Front Lanai (ground floor). There were never enough towels, we had 4 people in the room and they always brought 3, even when I checked they knew there were 4...or reminded them to bring or leave 4. The shower pressure was GREAT, however it drained very, very slowly and it really needs a door or something on it. I'm not sure who thought putting the closest in the shower area was a good idea, but it makes your clothes damp...bad idea. Our sink was leaking from the time we got there, until we left....even though we called to have it fixed, and they said they came to fix it. The light in the area outside the bathroom was out, and was never replaced either. The sliding glass doors to get out to the pool area are HEAVY, I'm sure it's for storm reasons, but it is very hard to open/close them. I did not like the bed/pillows and barely slept because of it, my husband did not have an issue. The rest of the room was ok, nothing special, but nothing bad. Pool/Hot Tub - The pool was nice as it was heated, however there were no towels in the area where they are supposed to be. I even asked an employee if he could get some more please, and he said sure. 20 minutes later, no towels....so I walked around dripping everywhere, oh well. The hot tub was not working when we first got there, but it was fixed later on. We enjoyed sitting in here quite a lot, but the second day it was being used a lot more and got disgustingly dirty so I stopped going in. Food/Drinks - We enjoyed the food we had here, especially breakfast. The portions are large, and tasted great. We had an issue trying to find someone to take our order the first day, the second day was a lot easier as we joined friends already seated. The drinks were great also for the most part, some are over-hyped on their menu, but I'll let you try and figure it out because you may like them. We had multiple staff tell us the initial bag of smores in the room are included with the room, but on checkout we were charged $10. I asked why, and they said the first bag is free, but you have to pay $10 to restock the next bag of them. Nice and tricky wording there people! Staff - I found that about half of the staff were great, and half couldn't wait to get out of the place and go home. This is from myself and the experience of the group of 11 I went with. The ones that were nice went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. The other ones were incredibly rude, and sometimes insulting. I'd also like to note, which is not included in my rating of the hotel, that I was not that impressed with Daytona Beach. The sand was hard and ugly, to include the water being pretty ugly looking as well. There was some surf good enough for my friends to surf a bit though, so they were able to have some fun. Oh, and it was ICE COLD in the water. I was not expecting it to be like Jamaica or St. Lucia, but with all the hype surrounding Daytona, I thought it would be a bit nicer. I'm sure if you have never been to the beach before, you will be happy, but I live in FL and have been to many other beaches around the world and in the USA. We did rent an umbrella, 4 chairs, and a little table from the guy on the beach for $50....and they were extremely nice and helpful. Our group did have a lot of fun because we were there together and we have fun pretty much anywhere we go!

The Shores Resort and Spa is the nicest of the accommodations we have found (and of course the most expensive). The hotel is clean and well-kept; the beach is pristine; the saltwater pool and jacuzzi were refreshing. We had an oceanfront king room with balcony. The additional services do add up and, since they're happy to charge everything directly to your room, the charges can accumulate quickly. I found the concierge to be singularly unhelpful in this regard. One problem might be that the concierge is also the check-in staff. To get as much info as one might want to be a savvy hotel guest, you would have to be willing to hold up the line (which I should have done). An example: We paid the $17/day resort fee so that we could use the fitness center (also covers shuffleboard, which I never saw, and bocce courts, which I also never saw). We did not know that the fee also covered self-parking. So we were charged an additional $16/day (plus tips) for valet service. Bike rentals cost an additional $18/half day (or $36 for full day), even though the bikes are onsite. Why is this not covered in the resort fee? The in-room information was inaccurate, so it was not a good guide. This is one example of several. If you want to reserve anything that might be in short supply (cabanas, which are only available for full-day rental at $70/pop despite the half-day option listed in the in-room information, or bicycles), call ahead and book the days you would like in advance. That said, we did enjoy our stay here. Waking up to the waves crashing and taking early morning walks on the gorgeous beach made up for the minor annoyances. Now that we know what to look out for, we will consider staying here again.

(May 6-12 ) Because of some of the reviews we hesitated to spend that much if it was going to be an unpleasant experience. The hotel looked very nice, though a lot of the ceilings were a little low as in the inside dining room, but to us, that was minor. We found the staff to be courteous, friendly and well trained. We stayed in the King oceanfront with a sofa and balcony. The room was neat and clean with the poster bed...just like the picture. There was crown molding and chair rail with contrasting paint that gave it a nice touch. We loved to prop our feet up on the large padded gold footstool and could look at the beautiful beach and hear the crashing waves or even watch the large T.V. The large mirror over the sofa was good to use when he was in the bathroom and I was appyling last minute lipstick or a last look before we went out for dinner. We ate at the Azure three different times and found the food to be good and not overpriced. We both had shrimp dishes the first meal there and it was so much food that there was no way to eat it all or store it.......... I would have been happy just to stay there and eat at the Azure, but we wanted to venture out and try some other places. The bathroom was nice the waterfall showerhead was great and the water must have had a softener because my hair behaved really well. The vertical mirror behind the bathroom door was also a plus. We walked the beach at least twice every day and looked forward to the lemon/lime/orange cold water that they had for guests by the pool. We did get the feel of being on a private island with the music by the pool that started around 10am every morning. We were on the 4th floor, so we had a nice view of the water, the pool and the activities going on....i.e. two weddings were performed while we were there. We did eat out every day and thought it was worth the 9 mile drive to Gene's Steakhouse. Genovese's Italian resturant is not far up the street at Port Orange and has wonderful lasagna, etc. at resonable prices. We did use the small refridgerator and just took the things out and put them on the dresser. They will charge a $25. fee if you have them come and remove everything out of it. The few negative things are that the in-room coffee wasn't very good, but the Publix up the street had some coffee that came in pouches that we bought. Also, they could have a little more storage for clothing in the room. The last thing was that they did have some construction repair going on...but that was so minor....the waves and the music covered up the little bit of noise that they made. Overall, we would love to go back in the future and had a good experience and would recommend it to others.

The room and hotel itself was nice except for the makeup stained bathrobe that was left in the bathroom right on top. So nasty that I took a picture to show my friends! How housekeeping could have left that for guests is beyond me. But that was not my biggest complaint. Before I booked the room for my boyfriends 35th birthday I was told that the customer service at the resort was out of this world. I was very excited to book a room here and enjoy. But before booking I called the resort to find out exactly the difference between the ocean front and ocean view rooms. Being as this was a special occasion we wanted the nicest view possible! So with excitement I booked the ocean front balcony and expected an unobstructed view of the ocean as described to me by the resort staff. Sadly when we checked into our room on the 2nd floor room 217 on the 20th that is not what we found. When we looked to the left all we could see was palm trees. Looking forward we had to look around the palm trees to see the ocean. To the right we again had palm trees. We had wanted to take lots of pictures to send to our friends but they are all blocked by trees. When I called the front desk, a not so friendly female told me that when booking through Jet setter that we are not guaranteed the room we paid for is what we will get. I find that statement very odd. Why pay more when booking a room anticipating something that is offered when we are really just taking a gamble on a room? When I got back to work and checked today, Jet Setter doesn't have any sort of policy like that. However it does have mention something about a king bed Vs. double bed availability. She also told me that the room we asked for WAS the room we requested, an ocean front balcony room. I will agree that it had a balcony and it was facing the ocean but it did NOT have a unobstructed view of the ocean and that was what I had expected and what I paid for! If that is true when was the management or staff last on the 2nd floor looking outside? That floor should be listed as ocean view NOT ocean front. That's just wrong to push it off on guests as anything other than that when your own staff explains the difference quite clearly! She told me the hotel was overbooked and we could not be moved. I can understand that. She also told me that she would talk to the manager and get back to us to see if there wasn't something else they could do. That never happened. It was like we didn't matter, me calling to complain was bothering her, and the view I paid for shouldn't be an issue. Good thing I am from Florida and this wasn't a once in a life time trip. If I was from Ohio and this was my honeymoon we would be livid. I just hope you don't treat everyone that books through a 3rd party this way. I also don't understand why we still have a $60.00 hold on our credit card. We ordered a $35.00 breakfast on the 21st. and already paid the $17.00 resort fee through Jet Setter.

In this day and age though I think charging for internet is uncalled for. Also, they were working on the roof at the time and this was a little noisy in the morning, but management made me aware of this at check in and offered a free cocktail hour for all guests to make up for the inconvenience. All in all I was very happy with my stay and should I ever find myself back in the area I will gladly stay here again.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCharming Beachfront Hotel\u201d", "Author": "EmilyandSam", "ReviewID": "UR121224332", "Content": "I liked The Shores! We got a great deal from Vacationist ($80/night) and decided to go explore Daytona Beach a little bit. The weather was wild and there was a wind and storm advisory warning, so the beach was empty, and unfortunately the pool and hot tub were closed. We had a \"partial ocean view\" room and it was truly just a peek of the ocean. The rooms were nice and the bed was super comfortable. The ambience of the hotel is great and we loved the lobby as well. The tiki bar outside was fun, as was the lobby bar. Daytona Beach really left a lot to be desired. There is not much to do around the hotel itself, but it's a great place if you want to spend the day on the beach or in the pool. We enjoyed happy hour next door at the Top of Daytona which is on the 29th floor and has sweeping views - don't miss it! Dinner at Azure, the Shores restaurant, was DELICIOUS and we loved the ambience - excellent service as well. They weren't lighting the fire pits because of the weather which was a bummer, because it looked like fun. The hotel will provide you with Smores Kits which are adorable but for $10 a pop, I'd recommend picking up a few Smores supplies at the store before you get there. They do charge a $17 resort fee, which includes Wi-Fi and self-parking. I dislike it when hotels charge this - I'd really rather have this built in with the nightly cost of the room. As we booked through Vacationist we didn't have to pay this fee, but were charged anyway. When I called the hotel after the fact, the service was excellent and they refunded the charge immediately. Overall, we really liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again if ever in Daytona Beach again.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

If you're going with children a first floor oceanfront would be advisable as you have direct access to the pool and beach sans elevator.

The plug sockets in the bathroom failed to work, leaving my wife to dry her hair in the bedroom - incidentally, there were very few plug sockets in the room, again - leaving us slightly disappointed. We ate dinner in the Azure restaurant and the food was very good. It was perhaps a tad overpriced but the wine and spirits outrageously so! The food was just about value for money but we weren't sure everything else was. If you got a good deal on price to stay here, you might view things differently but we felt, overall, we would probably have felt better elsewhere. The final indignity is the Resort Fee which many other reviewers have qustioned. It seem that there is so little provided for it, that it is effectively a management levy and should be added to the room charge if management is not to be continuously brought to task over it. How you can charge a valet parking fee on top of a $17/day Resort Fee, I'm not sure. All-in-all, I don't think that the Shores is anywhere near as good as it thinks it is and, unless it wants to see its TripAdvisor rating continue to fall, the management needs a long hard look at what its offering.

My husband and I were looking to do something special for our 5th yr. anniversary. His idea was to be frugal and exciting. Mine was to do something romantic. Without letting him know, I booked the room while hoping he'd never know how much we paid for the 2day vacation. Upon arriving, the hotel didn't look grand and glorious but the first service we received was valet parking. Kinda nice. We go to register and found that customer service was a priority! Every question was answered thoroughly with a genuine smile. We received complimentary drinks, asked for chocolate covered strawberries to be sent to the room and headed up to our room after being offered to take our luggage for us. Our check-in was late at night-around 9ish.. but anything we needed was still open and waiting on us to partake. Our room seemed basic...king bed, walk in shower and balcony. What was exceptional was when we realized we had a huge wrap around porch with ample sitting for star gazing. Our first night, we experienced the wonderful fire pits! The pool is salt-water and there is a hot tub.. which wasn't mentioned online I don't think. :) That made me verrry happy. Once we retired to our room, we found chocolate covered strawberries surrounded by a huge pile of berries awaiting us. We indulged for a minute before trying room service out. He ordered shrimp and I ordered a chicken club. GET THE CHICKEN CLUB!!!!! I hate chicken.. but my mouth is watering just thinking about that stupid sandwich! Which leads me to say this: the dining experience there cannot be matched unless you go to an exquisite restaurant. The next day we had a hiccup..no need to dwell because it was solved happily, readily and beyond my expectations! As I've mentioned, customer service is definitely a priority at this resort!! After the hiccup was resolved, we went on to enjoy the summer sun in the salt-water pool, had a nice shower and went to our couple\u2019s message. The girls did a superb job rubbing our cares away and nearly put the hubby to sleep. They too were very professional, yet caring. The hubby couldn't wait for dinner.. as mentioned before, the dining is excellent. Hats off to the chef! We found the menu a bit limited, yet still savory. I wasn't feeling well and couldn't find anything to suit my sick fancy. When I asked the waiter to see if the chef would mind surprising me with something light, the waiter was more than happy to ask and the chef (although I never saw him) seemed delighted to take my tastes to heart. He prepared for me a divine salad that again included chicken... and I LOVED it!! I would be aims to say that the hubby enjoyed his meal as well. It was a seafood bit with a ton of rice. Perhaps my special request overshadowed his dish... woops. Our last day there (and our actual anniversary date) would have been uneventful had it not been for the wonderful customer service. We received a late check out, so we eased into the day with a couple naps (again, the sniffles had me tired and not feeling well). By mid afternoon we found ourselves lounging in a cabana with a soft warm breeze, quiet music and the sounds of the ocean taking us off to one more nap. It was pure bliss! Suffice it to say, our stay was beyond our expectations. So very relaxing!! The next time I decide to take a nice vacation I will think twice about where to stay.

Upon our arrival, there were 2 things that we were particularly not pleased with. One was that the hotel does not own the beach behind it. Therefore, there are no chairs or umbrellas provided for guests. You must pay $30.00 a day for 2 chairs and an umbrella. When I called the front desk to inquire about this, I was told that the hotel did not own the beach, that it was \"public property.\" Being from NC, we were particularly not pleased with this as we have a variety of beach chairs, umbrellas, etc. that we could have taken with us, but did not because we thought a resort of this quality would provide these to theirs guests. We chose to go across the street down a ways to the Walgreens to purchase a beach chair and mat for our stay there. The second thing we were displeased with was the towels that they provide in the room for use at the pool. There was a sign downstairs by the pool that said these towels were for \"pool use only.\" However, the website shows that the hotel provides \"beach towels\" for guests. Since we did not bring any of our own beach towels because of this, I called the front desk and was told that they were pool towels, but \"unofficially\" you can use them at the beach, which we certainly did. The hotel as a whole is nice. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. The king-size bed was probably my favorite thing. It was very comfortable. I slept like a rock every night we were there. However, again the website reports that all deluxe oceanfront balcony guestrooms have four-poster king-size beds, but we did not have a four poster bed and we stayed in a deluxe oceanfront balcony room. We were on the third floor of the hotel just over the pool. A helpful tip: ask for a room on a higher floor. The pool area is noisy and there were a lot of kids. The pool is supposed to close at 10pm, but kids were swimming in it as late as 11pm or after. We called the front desk to complain the first night we were there, but nothing was done about it. The pool is nice; however, the pool area is very crowded. Unless you are early, it is hard to get a chair and umbrella. There were also ants everywhere around the pool and on the access to the beach! Ants! I don't know if this is a common problem in summer in FL, but I can't believe they would give this hotel a AAA 4 diamond rating with an ant problem. We will not be staying at his hotel again in the future; however, the Daytona Beach Shores area is very nice. There was not a lot of traffic on the roads when we would go out for dinner.

We ate on the pool deck on day ordering thru the pool bar. When we were finished we just left, hoping they would understand to just put it on our room. When we got back from walking on the beach the bartender tracked us down as we walked in the hotel yelling if we wanted to close our tab. It was so hard to take a shower with no shower door or curtain, it steamed up so bad, it just just a bad set up. One night 2 teen girls got into a fight like \"jersey shore\" throwing food in the pool, while their parents watched!! Guests came to the balcony trying to tell them to be quiet. It was a big scene of swearing and yelling. The hotel done nothing about it. The next day the teens girls were walking on the beach together. I also go a massage and it was not worth $20, like it was in a dark alley. I was so let down. Seems all they wanted was your credit card number and serve you drinks.

Cons: Expensive, pets not allowed anywhere on property except room, $50 per day extra pet charge, restaurant food wasn't that good, parking situation (across street or valet), wi-fi unreliable to non-existent, large screen plasma TV but no HD, extra charges. With resort fees, one dinner tab and one mini-bar tab, our four night stay was over $1700, plus tips. Parking is valet or across the street. There's a covered pedestrian bridge, but the elevator was out of service the first couple of days making it difficult to load stuff in and out. You can use valet if you don't come and go a lot, but it is $10 more per day plus tips. An attendant mentioned that valet parking is free for hybrids. When I made the reservation, they mentioned a $50 pet fee. They didn't mention that was per day. Pets aren't allowed in patio/tiki bar area or anywhere except rooms and lobby coming and going. They will allow pets to stay in room unattended (in crate) but we don't like to do that. There's a nice city park next door for walking the dog, and there are nice dog beaches at Ponce Inlet and Smyrna Dunes. This hotel was originally a Hilton years ago, and was featured in the NASCAR movie Days of Thunder. It was fabulous back then, and the nicest on the beach. The new owners have maintained it very nicely, the \"king suite\" rooms are a bit on the small side but if you get one with the spacious wrap-around balcony the views are awesome. Staff is friendly and provides great service. It's a very relaxing, fairly luxurious and romantic place. Probably not great for business travel, especially if you need wi-fi.

I can\u2019t wait to go back. The staff is welcoming and helpful. I arrived in late morning, had lunch on the terrace, and two spa treatments at Indulge before checking in afterwards right at 4 pm. I had a spa pedicure and the 50 minute massage medley and enjoyed them and the spa\u2019s d\u00e9cor very much. I had never been to a spa before and the service and surroundings were wonderful. My oceanfront king room with balcony was on the seventh floor (I was originally assigned to the 4th floor but had requested an eStandby Xtra Offer for a high floor add-on at time of reservation). When I checked-in they had a room available on the seventh floor but since the 8th floor and up is technically considered \u2018high floor,\u2019 the resort waived the add-on fee. The room was spotless, spacious, and charming. The huge walk-in shower did not flood the bathroom at all, and the cable television selection was good. I\u2019m not a fan of down pillows, so would bring my own next time. I particularly appreciated being able to control the room temperature. Not all oceanfront rooms have balconies \u2013 so if you want one, make sure the reservation says \u2018w/balcony.\u2019 I rented a cabana by the Tiki Bar for one full day and one by the pool for another \u00bd day \u2013 the one by the pool was the best because it was easier to stay cool. I loved being able to get food and drink out by the pool \u2013 and anyone can, not just people in the very comfortable cabanas. It was wonderful being so close to the beach \u2013 just emerge from my private cabana, walk down a flight of steps, and I was on the beach. \u00bd day in cabana was $40, not the $35 listed in the information folder in the rooms. Tax is added to that rental fee. Valet parking is $10/day. Lattes cost more than they would at a coffee house, and the alcoholic beverage prices were on the high side for the size of the drinks. Food in Azure restaurant was good, especially the Chocolate Chip Banana pancakes, Challah French Bread Toast, and the calamari. The Teriyaki Seared Flat Iron Steak was fabulous (I had it twice, once as dinner in my room). Unlike some previous reviewers, I had no problem with being overcharged on my bill at checkout (in fact, the resort had failed to note $80 in charges and I asked them to recalculate the bill for the higher amount). Only negative was I felt overlooked by the pool staff part of the time I was in the cabanas. A word with a member of the restaurant staff took care of that issue and all was fine after that. Tiki bar closed for repairs without warning on my second day \u2013 but service not really affected. Just a shame that I could not hang out there in the evening my second and third nights.

They recommended the four-diamond rated The Shores Resort & Spa, as well as some three-diamond rated properties that were significantly cheaper than The Shores. Wanting to make this a special time for our family, we chose The Shores for its professed extra amenities and four-diamond rating. That was a big mistake. Having been \u201cstuck\u201d before with extra fees for parking, we had our AAA agent contact The Shores directly to ask about extra charges because the property\u2019s website made no mention of additional fees. We were present when she was told by The Shores representative on the phone that there were no additional fees for parking unless we wanted valet parking, which was an additional $10 per day. Believing that we knew what our stay at The Shores was costing, we booked four nights. However, we found out after arriving at The Shores that they did, in fact, tack on additional fees that were not covered in the already high cost of the room. They charged us an additional $17 per day plus tax for \u201cself-parking\u201d; wireless internet access (it did not work half the time and was very slow when it did work); use of a fitness center which we never used; use of a dvd library?; a daily newspaper that you had to pick up downstairs (rather than at your door); local and toll free calls (give me a break, everyone has a cell phone these days), and use of tennis courts, bocce ball, shuffleboard, and horse-shoes at an off-site facility somewhere down the road. The fee was a total rip-off. The only thing of value was the parking, which we had been assured before booking was covered in the cost of the room. To make matters worse for us, the room was nothing special. About the only amenity that was not standard hotel fare was the very comfortable, four poster bed. Other than that, it was nothing you could not get somewhere else like the Holiday Inn or the Hampton. Additionally, one of the few lamps in the room did not work, the cold-water faucet leaked all over the counter, and the maid never replaced our pool towels during our stay. Otherwise, the pool area was pretty nice and the bellmen at the front door were always very courteous.

I had booked the \"Couples Retreat\" package directly on line from the Shores website. This package included a couple's ritual bath and a couple's massage in the spa area of the resort. First of all, the property is located right on the beach which, of course, is a major plus. This family friendly property is located south of Daytona Beach proper, near Daytona Beach Shores towards Ponce Inlet. For us this was fine because we didn't really want to be in the hustle of downtown Daytona Beach. Valet parking is offered, and was included in our package. Gratuties were included in our package. I will say that upon our arrival on Friday at around five pm the valet staff seemed to be shorthanded and somewhat confused, although pleasant. (Seems like the managemnt would recognize that this would be a busy time for check in.) Check in was fast and the lobby is very nice. By walking though the lobby from front to back, the doors open to a fairly large brick patio area where there is a hot tub, a pool, a tiki bar area, and several fire pit areas. The patio area opens to a view of the beach and the ocean. The patio area seems to be well maintained and clean. All of the pool attendants and bartenders at the Tiki were friendly and helpful. The inside hallways were clean and the carpeting there seemed in good condition. Our room was on the 8th floor with a partial ocean view looking to the South. There was a small patio area outside the room. This side of the building is very nice since just south of the resort building is a municiple park so there are no buildings immediately next to that side of the building. Essentially, we had an open view of the beach looking South as far as the eye could see. The room itself was big enough, however the carpet in the room was dated, worn and had some stains. The furnishings, which included a small couch, desk, desk chair and small arm chair were dated and tired. The bed frame (a four poster type bed) also seems worn.The mattress however seemed newer, comfortable and in good condition. The tv was an older plasma type television but not HD. There was a DVD player in the room, but only a small minibar type fridge in the room. Our remote did not operate properly but was quickly attended to when we called for assistance. The a/c controls were easy to operate and cooling worked fine. The bathroom was clean but is rather small and in our room the tub drained extremely slowly. We had dinner one night off property and then a dinner at the Tiki area on another evening. We did not eat at the Azure restaurant so I cannot rate that. The food at the tiki was good, delivered promptly and reasonably priced (for a resort). We had room service breakfasts each morning ordered from a card menu the night before and the breakfasts were good. The spa, located on the second floor, is small but adequate and our two masseusses were professional and competent. Now for the billing at check out. There were some major discrepancies on the final bill which I must say in all fairness were corrected by the checkout staff promptly and with no argument when brought to their attention. It is a shame, though, that they were there at all. Our couples retreat package included two breakfasts for two as part of the package. We had room service deliver both breakfasts each morning. On the final bill, I was billed seperately for the first morning's breakfast. Our package also included a \"$100 resort credit\" which I intended to partially use for our dinner at the tiki. However the tiki meal was also included on the final bill. Again, once I pointed these things out, the breakfast and the Tiki expense were removed from the bill, but there was over a $100 of extra charges on the original bill. I guess the lesson to be learned is to always review the final bill. We did not pay gratuties, not even to the spa staff, ( as that was part of the package) and that was nice since we didn't have to keep handing out money to the staff. I certainly hope the staff does indeed get the 17% gratuity. All in all this is a good resort establishment, perhaps somewhat overpriced and somewhat in need of refurbished rooms. The staff, however, were pleasant everywhere we encounter them and all seemed intent to make everything right.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but....\u201d", "Author": "CASETS", "ReviewID": "UR105248139", "Content": "I have stayed twice now, and would like to say that this is our hotel for visiting our college son on breaks but I am thinking seriously about our next time.

They gave us two non-communicating adjacent rooms, rather than the communicating rooms I desired. We decided yo tweak that and move on. I again this year received another minibar bill for almost $23 for various items when my husband only consumed 1 ($2)- same problem as first stay.

I grabbed a glass but it felt dusty like it had not been moved or sanitized for a while. I wanted to have some coffee but the coffepot's water compartment looked visibly moldy or dirty, which seemed encrusted. I have liked very much the valet, chose this time to opt for the parking across the street which I liked. Finally the breakfast bar is great- wished they had a chef to make fresh omelettes but that's ok. I was a little perturbed that after the waiter greeted us, he went on to anticipate us that the kitchen service may be affected because there were a bunch of new staff in the kitchen. As we had tge buffet, everything was perfect but tge preemptive bashing of the kitchen staff I thought was inappropriate and unprofessional especially when nothing had happened (yet) and we had just sat down. We hardly watched the tv but we couldn't understand tge issue of having a nice HD TV with no hd programming. There were also errors on the breakfast bill as well.

We arrived in terrible weather (thunderstorms, tornado watch, windy). The clerk basically just handed me my room key with little welcome and no information about the hotel, and when I had to ask basic questions such as where to park and what direction my room was in, she had to ask other staff members. There is a self parking lot across the street with a covered walkway to the hotel which was very nice (especially in the rain), and saved the cost of valet parking. We had an oceanfront room which was very nice. The shower was great and the bed was very comfortable. There was also a large flat screen TV. One of the resort's best features is the terrace with the pool, fire pits, cabanas, and tiki bar. The fire pits are awesome, but good luck getting one as they fill up fast. The wait staff on the terrace was extremely slow. It took 30 minutes just to get a drink. Some people in front of us ordered food, and when they were done their plates remained on the table for hours, even though the wind was blowing scraps of food on the ground. Our own empty plates and cups were still on the table hours later at 9 pm. We were also surprised the hotel seemed to often run out of things like pina colada mix and lemonade, and also the cappachino machine was broken. Their restuarant Azure was wonderful. We were able to get a table outside for dinner. The atmosphere was fantastic - relaxing as the sun set, light music in the background, and the fire pits lit up.

There was a light breeze and it was a gorgeous evening to be outside. There is a bonfire every night of the week and other guests were gathered outside enjoying the sound of the ocean. My waiter was equally fabulous and got me settled in with a great glass of Riesling and a menu. Little neck clams with pinot grigio butter sauce for an appetizer and the roasted all natural chicken breast with sweet potato puree, toasted mushrooms and asparagus, in brandy cream sauce. Easily THE best chicken I have ever tasted. DELICIOUS! I was off to bed in no time and had the best night's sleep of my entire week away. It was like sleeping on a cloud! Even though it was overcast the next morning, I had the beach to myself for a leisurely walk before heading out. I will DEFINATELY be back both for business AND pleasure.

Much improved from our last visit two yrs. ago. Check In was great-fast, and efficient and Best of all, our room was ready at 1pm; not the usual 4pm.

Our only regret was not having a balcony. Not every oceanfront room has one, but the view was gorgeous and worth the extra $$. The beds are extremely comfortable and maid service was great. Nothing worse than spending a day at the beach and coming back to a dirty room waiting for the maid to come! There's a mini fridge stocked every day, but we found the prices ridiculous. Go to one of the local convenience stores. Also, the safe was located on the upper shelf in the bathroom closet! Extremely inconvenient unless you're the Jolly Green Giant, and we aren't! PARKING Parking is available across the street from the resort with a convenient walkway leading directly into the hotel. You can use valet $7/day or self park as we did. The Shores is located in a quieter section of Daytona Beach, which was exactly what we wanted, but quite far to shops, entertainment and restaurants without a car. RESTAURANTS There is only 1 restaurant open for BLD. The Azure is the specialty restaurant for dinner; and a bar and snack bar near the pool. You cannot bring any food or drinks in the pool or beach area unless purchased at the hotel; but there's a few convenience and liquor stores nearby to buy what you need. We didn't try the hotel restaurants at all because there are numerous excellent restaurants in this vicinity. We tried a different restaurant every day and all were exceptional! BEACH The beach was very clean and beautiful with no rocks or debris to be found. Perfect for long walks on the beach. There are no palapas on the beach, but you can rent an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs for $30/day right in front of the hotel. You can also drive on designated areas of the beach for a $5 daily permit. POOL The pool/ hot tub area is very clean with lots of umbrellas for shade. Also, you can rent special tent/day beds in the pool area with bar and food service from the snack bar.

It was nice to be spoiled for a change after working full time and taking care of an infant. We loved our ground room oceanfront room. The grounds are nice, hotel is clean and staff is very pleasant. I was a bit worried about some possible noise from a bar mitzvah right next to our room outside, but it was pleasantly calm. I do hate resort fees ($15 per day) because I think they are a joke, especially in this economy (you get wireless internet (slow), hotel towels for pool, local telephone calls and some other emenities that I don't use). In my opinion, this should be included. Room service was slow, forgot my drink and the food was not worth a 1/4 of the price.

Our stay was fantastic! I have never taken the time to write a review before, simply because no other hotel had ever been worthy. This hotel is worth taking the time to write about. Everything was 5-star quality, from the comfort of the matress and pillows, to the food in the Azure restaurant, to the service, and the amenities. The staff went out of their way to make you comfortable and meet any need you had. They truly thought of everything at The Shores. They had a talented man doing live music out on the pool deck, fire pits they light at night to roast marshmellows or just sit around and sip a cool drink, and the food is oh so good. For breakfast, you should go for the buffet. It offers fresh fruit (BIG juicy blackberries, raspberries, watermellon, strawberries) a waffle maker with all the 'fixings', different egg dishes, bagles, incredible thick and lean bacon, raosted potatoes, everything- and it's only $14.95 including fresh squeezed OJ or other juice, and coffee. It kept us full until dinner. They have staff out by the pool grilling for lunch, or you can be served and sit at one of the outdoor tables overlooking the pool and ocean. I can't say enough about the service. They didn't let your glass get empty. They seem to work together as a team with other servers delivering refills on drinks, and asking if you need anything. The rooms are very comfortable. Lots of water pressure in the shower. Beautiful soft lighting and modern decorations. They have a large flat screened TV in the room. The bed cradles you, and the feather pillows are the icing on the cake. For a special drink, I recommend the \"Lori Special\". Not sure what's in it, but it's totally delicious!!! My husband decided we are going to make this an annual trip.

The tiki-bar/restaurant is wonderful - to eat great food on the ocean front! The restaurant is SUPERB. The Christmas decorations are so classy. The beds are very comfy.

When we checked in they were able to change us from a river view to a partial ocean view. No ocean view rooms were avaialable due to 2 conventions going on. I knew about the $15/day resort fee but wasn't expecting the $25.00 a day pet fee. I didn't mind too much because I had gotten a lower rate but wish hotwire would have told me that. Our room was comfy and clean although there was dental floss in the bathroom garbage pail that was a little gross. One of our lamp lights was burnt out but housekeeping quickly fixed that.

Also I notice some cabanas the put really small matresses and some ripped towel matress covers. I pointed that out to the staff and they fixed it promptly.

They never cleaned our room on the second day and we had to call down to get fresh towels and soap, which they brought up immediately. Breakfast was nice. The menu was reasonable for a resort. The food was very good, and the deck out by the beach, even though it was cold and overcast couldn't have been nicer. The service was a mess.

We were quite pleased with the large size of the room and bathroom as well as the decor.. My wife would have liked a tub, but the shower was satisfactory. Our package included breakfast every day, which we enjoyed thoroughly. The breakfast menu has a good selection and you can have your breakfast indoors or on a covered veranda. We also had a nice dinner at the Azure restaurant. I had a strangely cut NY Strip (like 2 triangles), but it was tender and juicy. My wife had a fish dish which she enjoyed. My wife took advantage of two included spa treatments, first the massage medely and then the magarita pedicure. (You guessed right, the pedicure comes with an included margarita). The decor of the lobby and indoor bar were really hansome with the dark mahagony walls. The view of the pool area and ocean from our balcony was spectacular. We also enjoyed the easy access from the pool area to the beach. The 2 fire pits, lit at dusk, were a nice touch. We didn't use the pool or the hot tub, but everything appeared to be well maintained. We did enjoy cocktails at the Tiki Hut Bar and Lorie the bartender was very accommodating. Ask her to make you Lorie's special which is on the bar menu. Valet service was always prompt. We also had good service from the bellmen. Now for our only complaint. Had we been told that we should simply sign for all our included package amenities and they would be adjusted off the bill at the end, service would have been flawless. However, since we weren't told, asking the service provider (such as at the restaurant, the spa, the bar) what to do only opened up a can of worms. The spa said you should have a certificate, the restaurant didn't know what to do, the bartender never heard of welcome cocktails, etc. After taking this up with the front desk, thehy said to simply sign the bill and it would be adjusted. Sounds great, makes everything alot easier, but when we got the bill left under your door the night prior to your checkout, it included all those prepaid items. When I called the front desk and asked why the bill hadn't been adjusted, the response was \"because, that's not your final bill\".

We had Ocean view rooms, 831 and 832, one with a balcony and one without. I would stay in the King bed when we go back as the 4 poster bed abscured the view of the tv and the tv is bigger in the King rooms. No balcony is good if you have small kids who are climbers like mine. The beds are very comfortable and the linens and pillows are very soft. There is a table and 2 chairs in the double rooms and a couch and ottomon in the king room that does fold out for kids. The bathroom was nice with granite countertops. The sinks are a little low, but not a big deal. The hotel is just beautiful inside. The paint colors and light fixtures are so unique. The staff was very nice and even changed our linens at 3am when our son wet the bed. The valet is only $7.00 a day and they are very quick, never had to wait for the car. The resturaunt had outstanding food. Expensive. They do have a minifridge, we took everything out from the minibar and used it for our milk and snacks. Even the little lunches they bring you out to the pool deck are wonderful. We ate breakfast and lunches there on several occasions and were all excellent meals. The pool and deck are very pretty and like a tropical oasis. Nice hot tub, no jacuzzi though. The pool is saltwater and heated. The kiddie pool is a regular little round one, but they do have a terrific splash pad area right next to it which my kids loved. they have tons of lounge chairs and cabanas to use. You can rent the cabans for the day for around $45 and that includes the cabana mattress and pillows. If no one is using them, you can sit on them and put your belongings there. They have pool towels that you can sign out. They have great pool deck service. There was staff coming around checking to see if guests needed food and giving out cups of ice water with lemon. There is also a locked gate that you have to have a code to get back in with. Nice for people who dont belong walking up from the beach. They have a nice spa, my dad got a massage and enjoyed it greatly. They did have a late checkout that is complimentary until 1pm. If you want to stay till 5pm, it is an extra $45.00 charge, which we took advantage of. I would definitly go back to this hotel. It is located on the south end of Daytona beach so there is less traffic, and no other big hotels are located nearby, mostly houses and condos. There is also a cute playground located next door to the hotel and has a nice ramp you can access from the beach. I am already looking at going back in November for my husband and my birthdays.

We stayed at the Shores Resort and secured a great price for the Presidential Suite through a friend who is an employee in the parent company. Here is our review: What God is responsible for (beach, ocean, weather): absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful beach and beautiful ocean. No complaints. What man is responsible for (Daytona Beach): There is no other way to put it but than to say it is a dump. We had not been before and found it to be a mixture of tacky souvenir shops, condo buildings (some nice, some shoddy), so-called 'resorts' and motels (several of which were closed down and in disrepair) and seedy looking bars. Daytona Beach is not a family friendly place, and I can now see why it is so popular with college kids who don't know or care any better. There really is not much to do there other than drink yourself silly. As for the Shores: As I mentioned, we secured the Presidential Suite thanks to a friend who works for the parent company. The suite is absolutely gorgeous. It was spacious, clean and located with a tenth-floor ocean view, including two balconies overlooking the ocean. We have no complaints with the room. Our only problem on the first of our two-night stay was the late-night noise made by the four heavily tatooed men staying in the next room. The constant humming noise sounded an awful lot like a tatoo machine, and they were loud and annoying, to say the least. I did meet an interesting lady coming out of the elevator who was clearly agitated and said to me, \"this hotel is a piece of ****.\" Apparently, this was her sixth stay, and she was upset that she had to move her own stuff from the 10th to 7th floor. Oh, well. That didn't bother us. We booked our stay in order to 'get away from it all' and relax with our children by the ocean. We enjoyed the resort location and easy access to the beach. The staff were friendly, and we had no complaints with them. Here is what you need to know about the Shores, which advertises itself as the area's only 4-Star resort: Unlike any other 4-Star resort I have stayed at (and I have visited a few), the Shores allows locals to come in and use its facilities. Now, I am the most social of guys, but my egalitarian nature balks at having to compete with non-paying locals (the Shores is definitely not cheap) for a seat by the pool (a small pool, FYI), a seat at the tiki bar or space in the pool itself. To make matters worse, the hotel has no way of vetting (nor does it seem to care) who comes in its doors throughout the day or night. Throughout our stay there was a steady stream of locals coming and going. Many of them brought coolers of beer in with them and sat by yhe pool, happy as pigs at a trough, consuming alcohol all day. Nowhere does the 'resort' make this open access clear in its advertising or anywhere else. You just have to discover it for yourself, as my wife and children did on our last night as they sat by one of the fire pits (a nice feature) roasting marshmallows. Bombarded by a stream of offensive language directed at the bartender by a clearly intoxicated woman, my wife politiely stepped in (I was in our room or the following would have had a much different ending, quite possibly with the drunk in hospital and me in jail) and asked the woman to mind her language (the 'f' bomb was flying liberally) as there were children around the area. She was met with a foul invective as the drunk (it emerged she was a non-paying local) took none too kindly to being called to task for her foul mouth. Worse still was the fact my children had to see their mother treated this way. Security was nowhere to be seen and after my wife made a legitimate stink to the restaurant manager, the rowdy drunk and her two companions were asked to leave. I spoke with the manager about this unacceptable situation. She was kind enough to sympathize and reduced our bill by one night. However, our experience raised an important concern for would be guests at the Shores. This policy of allowing locals in with no 'quality control' is at best unfair and inconvenient to paying guests. At worst, it represents a major liability for the guests and the hotel. This place does not differentiate (or care) between who the paying guests are and locals. You need to know this before making a reservation. You may be fine with it. Not me, and we will not be back. In fact, had we known this before we made our reservation, we would not have stayed there. It is just not what I want or expect when staying at a supposed 4-Star resort. I told the manager this was disingenuous. Buyer beware! If you don't mind having to compete with non-paying locals, you will probably enjoy the Shores. Next time, we will make sure we ask the question \"do you allow non-guests on property?' before we make a reservation. One last observation: We have stayed at several resorts. You should also know they charge a 'resort fee' on top of the room rate. It covers all the stuff (paper, pool towels, wi-fi) that many other places include in the room rate. Our experience at the Shores proves demonstrates there can be a vast difference between two resorts with the same rating. This one is definitely at the 'economy' end of the scale (not necessarily in price, though) of resorts.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Florida", "Title": "\u201cI'll come back\u201d", "Author": "JoanieZ", "ReviewID": "UR36914768", "Content": "I stayed one night on July 14th and again one night on July 21st.

Even though parking is across the street, valet parking is offered and is very convenient. The $7 charge is waived if you drive a hybrid (I do.) Check in on the 21st took longer than it should have. Our bedroom layout with 2 canapy beds provided an obstructed view of the large TV. The bed poles were in the center of the TV. The resort fee is supposed to allow for newspapers and robes. That did not happen. The fee was charged, but the amenities were absent. I found that a room with a balcony exceeds a room looking over a concrete surface with AC units. Children unsupervised were allowed in the hot tub. Too many kids in the hot tub. No fire was lit in the pits. There was a fire during my previous stay two weeks earlier. The tiki bar service, both food and drink was wonderful. When I checked out, my statement was incorrect. The hotel as well as priceline.com charged me for a night's stay. The hotel had to re-do my statement; they did so but with an attitude. The bell hop and valet guys were very friendly and helpful. They even offered to help while I waited at the check-in kiosk.

Most of the staff was friendly and would go out of their way to offer assistance. I asked a housekeeper for a toothbrush and she went to another floor and found one. (I had called the front desk first, waited an hour or so, no response, ) so I walked down the hall and found a housekeeper.

For nearly twenty five years then my family and I have been frequent guests at this hotel \u2013 even as gradually, over years, that vaulted service degraded, crumbled through lack of training and poor recruitment, then eventually \u2013 even as a Hilton \u2013 disappeared. Our last lunch in the restaurant just before the hotel changed hands was a Pizza \u2013 and we had to wait while it was delivered! When The Shores Resort and Spa opened were rather cautious about returning \u2013 it seemed expensive too. But the compliments and rumors of great service grew, so after an absence of nearly two years, we stopped in one weekend and dined there. By the end of that lunch we were booked into the hotel, our only luggage - a couple of those First Class \u2018goody bags\u2019 of toothbrush, eyeshades and a comb that used to be given out by airlines to their customers free of charge. (I felt I had better explain that bit of airline history!) We could not enjoy an Oceanside on that occasion, literally walking in off the street as we did, but we did enjoy the service. As you can see from all the accolades posted here, The Shores is a very special destination to most of its guests and it is obvious from the repeated comments on the staff and service teams what it is that makes The Shores special. The people. Oh..and the food! The Azure Restaurant tries very hard to be VERY fine dining and often succeeds \u2013 the staff has become very educated about the menu and, of course, the service is great. As other guests have commented The Shores has got to be the very best hotel in Daytona \u2013 and there is a lot of competition. We now even have the Hilton back, taking over the Adams Mark and creating a much more welcoming high service hotel. But we are now too brand-loyal to The Shores to stay anywhere else. Try it out \u2013 we have used the Spa, room service, restaurants, beachside dining, and had Laura and her great team in the pool area give us cheerful and friendly service when we use the Cabanas. We have tested everything over our visits and love going back. Any problems? Yes of course that is life, but they will be resolved \u2013 often by the empowered team members themselves. We think you will enjoy your stay because of this enthusiastic staff.

I believe that this is, hands down, the best hotel in the area. It has everything that you would expect from an upscale beach resort in terms of pool area and beach access. I really liked how all of the outdoor activities are right outside the door. Many large resorts have all of the amenities spread out, but everything is really just steps from your room. Very nice pool area (with cabanas) and a nice beach. Azure, the restaurant, is really the only place to eat. Breakfast buffet (eggs seemed like powder, potatoes were bland) was sub-par, lunch was really good, and dinner was excellent. One thing to watch out for is the prices of food/drinks. I know that it's a resort, but we were charged $6 for a glass of orange juice, $2.75 for a small bottle of water, and $17 for a glass of average champagne. I think we'll stick with ice water next time! :) The rooms were really nice. Flat screen tv, spacious balcony, and really clean carpets, linens, bathrooms. Slow drain in the bathtub (I hate that), but everything else was great in terms of the room. As far as the service (and this is not something I usually care too much about), it was noticeably slow and inaccurate. Bar/restaurant service was just extremely slow. Servers seemed to forget things, needed to be asked 2 and 3 times for things like sweetener, drink refills, etc. Our server at dinner spilled a beer down my back when he was bringing the drink tray over (just an accident, but seemed to be par for the course). Despite the misses in this area, everyone was really nice and hard-working. They just seemed stretched pretty thin. Maybe they are understaffed for the summer. Regardless of that, I really enjoyed the stay there, would return, and would recommend it to others. I think that it's a wonderful facility with nice people.

We were even given a free upgrade and were delighted! Within 5 minutes we had the keys to our room and I headed upstairs. We were exhausted so I turned down the bed while I waited for my husband to come up with our bags. It was then that I saw a shadow beneath the sheet, on the mattress cover. I lifted up the sheet and the mattress cover was horribly blood stained and slightly pee stained. I have stayed in all kinds of hotels in my life and have never been confronted with such a thing. I pulled the sheet back down and then noticed that the white blanket was blood stained too. I called housekeeping and they sent someone up right away. She was very apologetic and visibly shocked when she saw the condition of the bedding. She assured me that the staff is held to a very high standard and that things like this are not taken lightly. Still, it was quite a disappointment considering how much we were looking forward to this trip and the supposed caliber of the hotel. The room itself was beautiful, though the lamp on the right side of the bed did not work and the desk lamp flickered continously when turned on. These things are not typically a huge deal but I expected everything to be top notch at this place. The bed was comfortable and the layout was impressive.

When we (wife and myself) got to our room, it was well appointed, byt upon reading the in-room directory, it said that Robes were in every room, and that newspapers would be delivered to the room each day. We did not have Robes in our room and did not receive a paper the next morning. Upon calling the operator and asking to speak to the General Manager, we were told that he was on vacation, and would we like to speak with the Rooms Division Manager? I asked to be connected to him, and of course, got his voice mail. I called the operator again and asked that he be located. 30 seconds later, David Smiley answered my call. I explained everything to Mr. Smiley, and his comments were that they had discontinued the newspaper delivery, so save costs (yet the still charge $15 resort fee, which free newspaper delivery is part of) and also told us that Robes were now available for rooms that pay a certain rate structure, but, because we were upset, he would have 2 Robes sent to our room. This is pretty much the level of service you will receive at the Shores. Complain about something loud enough, and they will fix it. They have really nice fire pits, at the pool area, however, in the 5 nights we were there, they were never cleaned. Cigarette butts laying in the pit, as well as around the seating area. They even raked the area, but NEVER picked up the butts. We asked Mr. Smiley why the cigarette butts were not picked up, and his response was, \"Unfortunately we only pick up this area once a week.\" I guess it must have been one of the other two days of the week that we were not there. There we servers at the Tiki Bar area, that were supposed to wait on the guests at the pool, but they never did. They just sat and talked with friends. The staff at the desk would not address the guest first, you had to address them. You would get coffee in the morning at the lobby bar. One morning, four guests were waiting to get coffee, when a lady from the restaurant saw us waiting, and instead of asking us what she could do for us, she asked if we were just watching tv.

This would have only been a problem if I brought a lady back to the room, but that sure didnt work out the way I wanted. The other complaint would be food/drink at the costs a lot more than it should. I would think those areas would get more business if the prices were lower. I did get room service one night, and the food wasn't bad, but again just more expensive than I would have liked.

One thing is for sure, this is the BEST hotel in Daytona Beach. I was out for a romantic weekend in Daytona (came from Virginia) and once again decided on this hotel. We thought we had booked a partial ocean King bed and I called to confirm this 7 hours before arrive (since we would arrive at midnight). When we got there the hotel was sold out but for an Ocean View with two beds or a River View with a King bed. This was a little annoying seeing as I confirmed and we ended up with a River View. Now if you read that and are thinking \"so why did you love this hotel?\" than read on because all hotels make mistakes but it is the ones that go above and beyond to make you happy that are fantastic. So we got to our room and crashed since we were tired and thought we would deal with our situation tomorrow. Well we got up and had breakfast at the hotel (expensive but good) and we ended up staying at the hotel the entire day. Why? Because it is beautiful. It is calming yet fun. You can start off with a walk on the beach followed by laying at the pool with a few drinks. Later on you can sit in the hot tub and dry off by the many fire pits they have. So around mid day we thought about it and decided that it doesn't matter what room we are in because we were sooo relaxed as is. We ended up saying nothing about to the staff and would just address our concerns later since I didn't want a change of room or anything discounted. Yes, the hotel was THAT calming on me. I could go on about the beauty of this hotel but let me talk about what happened when I left and was asked to give a survey via email. I'm always very critical in surveys because they help provide constructive feedback to those running the place. I wrote about my situation and stated a few other concerns I had. Within TEN MINUTES of submitting the survey the MANAGER called me up to discuss the survey. I told him about how we didn't want to address the problem at the hotel because we were having a good time and he understood. I also told him I didn't want anything for my troubles because we had a good stay. Well we talked for awhile and he agreed with some of my comments and gave me his personal email address so the next time I stay with his hotel he will book the hotel for me. I really can't describe the conversation I had with him but I was extremely satisfied with how well he listened and addressed my concerns. Not only that, but he recommended a hotel near where I live (and is not related to the hotel he currently works at). Crazy! So here is the bottom line, I had a MINOR problem and it was addressed above and beyond what I would say is needed for \"great service\". Furthermore the hotel is the best, most relaxing yet fun hotel in Daytona Beach. My only recommendation now is for some lower prices on the drinks which are high even for a nice hotel. There may be some reasons I don't know that cause this, but lots of folks I met ended up bringing their own drinks (bought from the grocery stores) ha! So just book your hotel here. I will again and, in fact, I am looking at having a wedding there!

The comfortable bed linens, the big screen tv, the snacks in the fridge (healthy ones too!), the mini bar, the extra pillows and blankets! The pull out couch was just as comfortable!

There are great little areas for toddlers too! The tiki bar was great to go to at night and nice ambience with great soothing music.

While the hotel was very nice, I have to agree with the others who said the \"extras\" made it a little too pricey. The drinks at the Tiki Bar were $9 on average, with beer being around $5 I believe. For me, $9 for a mixed drink is just too much. It was also nearly impossible to get lounge chairs, in the sun, on the pool deck. I'm not sure how it would be policed, but offering chairs on the beach (at no charge) would be a nice perk. I know that would be difficult as it is a public beach, but I'm guessing if they had one staff person on the beach monitoring the chairs/tables, it would be pretty easy to control. One more complaint is the ice machine on the 10th floor didn't work the entire time we were there (4 nights). It wasn't a major deal because the machine on the 9th floor worked, but just a little inconvenient and frustrating that in 4 days, they never fixed it. A four star hotel shouldn't have those types of glitches. As for the room - ours was very nice. Personally, I LOVED the showers - great water pressure and a shower head that extended to be positioned directly over your head, pointing straight down on you. The bed was wonderful - probably the softest and most comfortable I have ever slept on. The front desk staff and valet staff were always very friendly with a \"hello\" when we returned to the hotel. One of the front desk staff, Mr. Smiley, was outstanding. He was at the desk the day we checked in and then had the next two days off. We saw him again the day we left and he remembered who we were and talked to us about the same things we talked about the day we checked in.

We couldn't have been happier....we are 23 and 24, on my college spring break. We didn't want to be around all the people partying, so we chose not to stay in the middle of all of it! We were so happy to have found The Shores. I booked the vacation and we were in a river view room without a balcony, and at check in I asked if we could pay to upgrade to a balcony. I was told they didn't have any balconies available, but that he could upgrade us to ocean front without a balcony, which was still better than river view. When we walked into our room, to our surprise, we had a balcony and oceanfront!! We were very pleased with the service we received. At one point we were walking up the drive and the person valet parking a car was driving down the drive. He seen us coming up, backed the car back up the drive that he was parking and got out and opened the door to the hotel for us! If that's not five star service, I don't know what is. The housekeepers also came to our room at 2, 3, 4 in the afternoon. If they hadn't been there in the morning, because the DND sign was hanging, someone ALWAYS came back late in the day to tidy up the room. The shores is down the strip from all of the \"main\" hotels in daytona, maybe about three miles, but if you're not wanting to be in the middle of everything, yet close it's a great place to stay! The only complaint we had was the way the showers were set up water always leaked all over the floor, so we had to lay a couple of towels down to contain it. Not a big deal, just an annoyance. It wouldn't stop me from going there again....I've seen a complain or two about having to park across the street, and I'm going to comment that it's a gated parking lot, that isn't crowded, and there is a covered bridge above the traffic so there is no waiting for cars to go by.

All the staff there were very attentive and I feel like I was a VIP. I originally booked it through Hotels.com for a river view room. Upon arriving around noon, my room was available. I then asked if I can check out the ocean view room to see what it's like and it's much better as the bathroom was much bigger and nothing beats stepping onto the balcony and looking out onto the ocean. I paid the extra for the upgrade to ocean front and it was well worth it. You can hear the ocean waves coming in and watch the beach all day long. The bed was the most comfortable I've stayed in. There were so many pillows that makes you not want to get out of bed nor the room. The pool area was great as beach towels are provided. I was told the outdoor swimming pool is heated but didn't get into it. There's a small kiddie pool, two fire pits & a hot jacuzzi. You can relax on the pool deck or go out onto the beach. There's a code to get back onto the pool deck so it's good to keep the non-hotel residents out. There's Publix (grocery store) 1 mile south on A1A. Parking across the hotel is free and there's a pedestrian overpass so you don't have to worry about crossing the street. Valet parking is available for $7/day as well.

I could compare it to some of the best that I have stayed. Now I will say reading the reviews, I probably should have gotten a rate under $100 like the rest on hotwire/priceline etc. I just compared hotels.com to their own website, both were $111 per night, so I booked on the Shore's website. With taxes and resort fee it came to about $140 a night, which I dont mind paying, but if some people dont pay this resort fee, I feel that is unfair. I used the towels, parking and internet which the resort fee covers. We ate at Azure the restaurant 2 times. We actually never sat in the Azure 'secton' . The first night off the plane we grabbed a bite to eat outside while a guy played the guitar. He was great and he played a great selection of music. He was very courteous and let my boyfriend hook up his computer to send a report for work. The food was a touch pricey, but only by $2-3 per entree. What you expect in a tourist area. The next time we at at Azure we had breakfast and it was WONDERFUL. We had the scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese in them!! Delicious and again only about $2 more than normal. I actually got ice water from the Tiki Bar several times and the staff was super-nice and gave me the water without any qualms since it was Free. The rooms were wonderful. Great size, great comfy bed, nice view on the intercoastal, didnt want to pay the $60 upgrade for oceanfront. Nice flatscreen TV. Great toiletries..nice high end products. Nicely decorated, very classy-beachy, not cheesy-beachy. Pool Deck was great. Tons of little kids in the pool, but we could sit on the other side of the the Tiki Bar and enjoy peace and quiet. Now the music they played was horrible. It was like Adult Contemporary/Motivational/Inspiration Music. They claim they are doing the 'south beach' feeling, but if so the music needed to be updated to house, instrumental or even beachy music. I had to use my IPod to keep my sanity it was that bad. Towels were ample and the spa (hot-tub) was very nice. We never used the fire pits, but if we had time we would have used them. Never went to the Spa, WAY overpriced, about $150 for mani-pedi, that I pay $35 for at home, maybe $80 in a spa. But not a problem, bc I didnt come down to FL for that...

Top Notch!\u201d", "Author": "Gracetanner", "ReviewID": "UR18850330", "Content": "We stayed at the shores for 4 days this last week. This is a gorgeous property, and I was extremely happy with our stay. Being the critical traveler that I am, I consciously looked for things that weren't up to par for a 4 star resort. I found none. This was top notch in my book. I booked our stay through hotwire, and got a wonderful rate of $74 dollars a night. After reading other positive reviews, and also noting that the Shores is the only 4 diamond resort in Daytona, I was sure I got a great deal,and now, I am positive we did. Also, I have to note, we were not charged the $15 resort fee noted in some other reviews. We parked in the free parking across the street, and received coffee and the paper for no additional charge. The resort is located conveniently in Daytona Beach Shores, right on the A1A. The area surrounding the resort is less seedy than some other areas in Daytona. The hotel itself was very attractive on the outside and as we pulled up to the front, I was already impressed with the drive under. It was very elegant. Immediately, the service was excellent, as our doors were opened for us, and we were helped out of the car by 2 very attentive bell hops. As we entered the lobby, I continued to be impressed with the beautiful decor, and elegant fountains. As other reviewers have stated, the check in process is a little different, as there is no \"front desk\", but rather podiums that the service \"ambassadors\" stand at. Our \"ambassador\" was very helpful and polite. I told her that since I booked on hotwire I was sure we didn't have beach front or ocean view. I asked if she could check on upgrade prices. She checked for me, and the difference was $60 a night. She assured me however that the view from the 9th floor of the intercoastal waterway was breathtaking at sunset, so we opted to stay where we were. I asked her if there was a balcony on our room, and there was not. She quickly did a search and changed us to a room with a private balcony. I was happy with that. The room itself was huge. We had a king bed, one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, ever. We also had a pull out sofa and really, the mattress on that wasn't shabby. Much better than some I've seen. The view was great, though it made me nervous being up that high. The girls that cleaned our rooms were very nice and prompt. One morning we ordered breakfast in.The gentleman that delivered it was a delight. Our kids loved the shores, although I do agree with the previous reviewer that stated that this would be a very nice resort for a couple and I thought it would be nice for a girlfriend getaway as well. The pool area was really beautiful. The water was always warm and the pool wasn't overly crowded. I liked the atmosphere of the pool area. Very tropical. On the last night we were there, there was a live band. If we were sans children, it would have made an enjoyable night, relaxing by the ocean and listening to the band. The beach right in front of the shores was quiet. I had many reservations about the beach being \"drivable\", since my children are young. I was worried about having to watch them in the water, and also worry about them running into traffic. Where I can see this actually being a problem further down the beach where the traffic lanes are closer to the water, it really shouldn't be a concern on the area of beach where the Shores is located. The traffic lanes are far up and there is a degree of separation between where you play and where the traffic is. A note about the service at the shores: we felt they went above and beyond for us, more than once. We bought a stroller at a local wal-mart because we left home without one, and it needed assembly. One of the bell boys and a service ambassador helped us quickly with some tools we needed to get the job done. Every employee we encountered spoke to my children, and that wins me over in a heart beat. The only negative I can speak of is the same thing you get with any 4 star resort. The price of the food, the mini bar, the drinks were high. But not more than expected. We went to wal-mart and stocked up on snacks, waters, and juice boxes for the kids. Oh, and one other thing-- I felt room service menu, the one they offer for late nights was kind of skimpy. And expensive. All in all, we loved our stay at the Shores. It was great.

I booked this hotel on hotwire. It was listed as a four star in Daytona Shores. We paid $89 a night. Hotwire quoted $206. We were notified that there may be resort fees. The Shores charged an additional $15 a night for \"resort fees.\" When I asked what was included in the resort fee, I was told the parking, the newspaper, the coffee in my room, and access to the fitness room. It seemed like a flimsy fee. So please factor that into your consideration when booking this hotel. We just left Port Canaveral that morning from a cruise. It is about an hour away. The hotel room was huge. We were thrilled with the size. My husband and I thought the beds were full size. They were large canopy beds. They were extremely comfortable with great thread count. We had 2 adults and 2 children. When we entered the room there were two stuffed bears on the bed. There is a little paragraph written in the hotel manual ( who reads these things) that said if you take the bear you will be charged afterward. When my children asked the bell boy about whether or not they could keep the bear, he said he wasn't sure but he thinks we need to purchase it in the gift shop. I felt this was wrong to put this in a room with kids and then tell us to pay for them. There were no price tags on the two bears in our room. I felt it was deceiving. The hotel itself is beautiful. It has great access to the beach and a nice pool. We were able to sit by the pool and let the kids run around the beach. The rooms are very large. This was great after being on a cruise for 4 days. There is a DVD player in the room which was great for the kids. The restaurant was scenic being located outside. Although we did not use the spa, there seemed to be a lot of choices in services. We did not eat at the restaurant. The prices were ridiculous for a family to eat. They recommended a great pizza place called Genovese. We did have a pitcher of margaritas and it was $48. There are no prices posted or anything. The bar service was slow. We ordered virgin drinks for the kids and it took a long time for the kids to get their drinks. Within a couple of miles there is an IHOP, Denny's, Burger King, and grocery store if you are looking for Breakfast food. The parking for the hotel was located across the street. That was included in the resort fee. They try to push the valet parking for $7 a day in addition to the $15 that you are already paying. The location of the hotel is in between the activity. Daytona is North of the Shores. The Hilton seemed to be the place to be there if you have a family. They had a Johnny Rockets and a Bubba Gump attached to the hotel and a Dunkin Donuts across the street. Everything is in walking distance in case you don't have a car. South of the hotel are a variety of newer and older hotels. We found ourselves driving to get food. We did get miss-billed the last day. We were at a friend's house all day and got charged and additional $60 for a turkey club and a drink. Somehow it was billed to our room. I called down to the front desk and they said they would send me an adjusted bill. I finished packing the room and by the time I got downstairs they still had not adjusted my bill and sent me the new copy. They said they could not find the signed receipts from the meal. I said that is because we never ate there. They did adjust it and printed out a new copy with the new final price. Things I like about this hotel: -location on the beach...it seemed very isolated -quietness ( but we did have loud neighbors our last night) -beauty of the hotel -the huge rooms Things I am not sure about this hotel: -additional resort fees. Hampton Inn gives you your paper for free and doesn't say the fees are to pay for your coffee in your room. -the bear scam with the children -distance to other restaurants -turn down service ( she came by the first night, but didn't come by the second?...if she did we didn't notice) I would recommend this hotel for an adult getaway. If two adults don't want to leave the place and really relax, this is the place. You can enjoy gourmet food ( my local friend says that the buzz on the restaurant is that it is fantastic), my spa services and options, and relaxing by the pool or beach with a great beverage. If you have kids, it can be a bit more challenging. The size of the room is great for 4 people. It is way larger than a standard hotel room. There is the DVD player in the room. The food is very expensive and we didn't want to waste the money on the children. We were able to let the kids run around on beach while we watched for the pool deck. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room. We visited with our friends. I would consider this for a post-cruise hotel. Large room and very relaxing.

We are from the Gulf side of Florida, which tends to be a little more low-key with lovely hotels, quieter beaches and an atmosphere that caters to just about every interest. We started out on the north edge of the beach strip at The Plaza Hotel. It was dirty and grimy with an unsavory bunch of vacationers. There was actually a fight in the parking garage while we were there. When we realized what sort of element we were surrounded by, I immediately pulled out my laptop and logged in to Trip Advisor. One reviewer seemed to have the same experience and wrote they had gone over to The Shores. We phoned The Shores and fortunately they had openings. We packed up and checked out and couldn't have been more thankful. The difference in hotels was like night and day. The Shores was a dream. The rooms were well-appointed with an incredibly comfy canopied bed with Egyptian cotton sheets. We kept the sliding doors open at all times for the lulling sound of the waves. The marble bathrooms were roomy with a great shower. The pool was fabulous with canopied cabanas and fountains for the kids to play in and a Tiki bar with a friendly and accommodating staff. Because, we checked in that day, they did have to put us on a smoking floor with a promise to move us when anything opened.

Unbelievably, there was not even a trace of smoke smell in the room and I have an incredibly oversensitive nose. I don't know how they do it, but we didn't even feel the need to change rooms. Our view and room were so lovely. We were only able to book a room for 3 days even though we wanted 5, because the hotel was full on the weekend. They told us, they would let us know if there were any cancellations and by our second night, they had informed us they had the availability. The fires on the pool deck at night were fun. My kids got S'More packs from the restaurant and had a blast making their favorite treat. Like I said, at the beginning, we were nervous coming into our vacation, due to Daytona's reputation for attracting a hard-partying crowd, but our stay was so wonderful, we booked an additional 2 nights. That side of the beach was great. We rented a golf cart one day and we were shocked at the difference on the beach, the further north you go. It was much more populated, I'd say three to four times more congested with a ton more cars and utter chaos. The Shores is situated in what seems to be a quieter area. Our girls rented bikes several times and had no problem navigating around on that side of the beach. One note, if you're looking for fine dining, there's not a lot in the Daytona area. The hotel restaurant was good, but even better was The Chart House. We've been to a Chart House in other parts of the country and once again, it did not disappoint. The views of the water are lovely and the food is fabulous. Our last day at the Shores, there was a sailboat regatta in the water right in front of our hotel. It was a beautiful, sunny day and between the view of the sailboats from our room, the attentive staff and the luxurious room and hotel, we didn't want to leave.

Free parking across the South Atlantic Avenue (connected to the hotel by a skywalk) was an added benefit. The only small glitch in our wonderful stay was the fact that we had to call housekeeping twice to have the bathtub unblocked (but it was done efficiently and immediately the second time we called down to reception) and that housekeeping was stingy with those wonderful Molton Brown bath products (our stock was replenished only once in a 4 night stay).The other hitch, not a fault of the Shores, was with our reservation via Skoosh.com (made close to a month before our stay). We were delighted with the excellent rate we obtained, but calling to confirm our reservation a couple nights before our arrival, we found the hotel had no record of it.

I was back this weekend and wasn't disappointed. It's a medium sized hotel that has a small hotel feel. When you walk into the lobby you are greeted with an elegant yet comfortable atmosphere. The front desk is made up of two podiums to your right which makes the check in process seem less of a \"process\" and more like a greeting from your host. They play beautiful music in the lobby that wafts to the upper floors which all open up to the lobby in an atrium fashion. The rooms are down hallways and closed off, but the elevators and meeting rooms are off of this open area that allows you to enjoy the beauty of the lobby as you come and go. The bar is located at the far end of the lobby and has a cozy, warm feel. Saturday night they had great live music playing. What really completes the ambiance, is when you step out to the pool area. The hotel is right on the beach. The pool area is tastefully decorated with comfortable lounging furniture and even has the \"bed\" lounges piled with pillows. There is a fire pit area that looked very appealing on a cool December night and the tiki bar looking right out to the beach and ocean. Once you get to your room, the delights continue. They have chair rails and crown moldings and cool comfortable blues and yellows on the wall. The art work is not your typical hotel cheap looking prints. The flat screen TV and DVD player are nice touches. The bathroom makes you stop and wish it was your bathroom at home. There is a Kohler bowl sink sitting on top of the counter and the shower has a wonderful shower head and an open glass look. I didn't like hte closet being in the bathroom, but that is my only criticism. My room had a balcony and faced out to the ocean. I think all the rooms have balconies, but some are on the side of the hotel and don't provide a great view. But the ones on the back are awesome. The sound of the surf is loud and wonderful. I got a great December deal on Hotwire for just $79 but the rate directly with the hotel was just $90. That will change as we get more into the season and when Bike Week and the Daytona 500 are going on. But if you're there at the right time, a rate like that is something you shouldn't miss This hotel is worth $300 a night easily. I am not a huge fan of Daytona Beach though. I was only there because a friend was visiting from out of the country and is taking some classes there. But I was thrilled for an excuse to stay at the Shores.

Needless to say, the next night I ordered room service which was wonderful... quick and friendly service. Next door is the Top of Daytona Restaurant which has a fabulous 360 view of Daytona and more reasonable prices. Pool/Beach Area: Pool deck was crowded and it was hard finding a spot. Pool was small. Beach area was well-kept and beautiful. Gym: Small and equipment was too close to each other. Spa: Did not use. Service: I expected a lot more from this resort. I had problems with the tv in my room and called to have the problem fixed. The person on the other end 'talked me through' resetting the tv. I was attending a conference at the resort and asked for a late check-out (1 hour) and they stated they could not accomodate my request, so I left the early. Location: This was my first time in Daytona. The resort is secluded and if you don't have a car, your options are limited. Around the hotel it's pretty dead and I walked a mile in both directions. Overall: For the value, I definitely expected better service.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cOK but Daytona Beach aint great\u201d", "Author": "jtkoo", "ReviewID": "UR7681534", "Content": "Stayed at the Shores Resort while in town on business. Although the outside is not too impressive, the interior is rather nice. The rooms are spacious and bright, decorated in bright, seaside decor. Rooms included comfortable beds with feather tops and large flat-screen TVs. The view was rather disappointing however. I was supposed to have a \"water-front\" room. However, the room was actually located on the side of the hotel, and overlooked the roof of an adjacent section of the building (and I was subject to the constant wrhrrr of the A/C units) and the parking lot. Off in the distance you could see some of the beach. Oh well. Service was spotty. I had no offers of help when I pulled up to the door, nor when I left. The business center was apparently being renovated during my stay, but they placed a laptop in the lobby for guest use. At night, the staff was particularly helpful, even allowing me to use their own computers to print out my boarding pass. Housekeeping was rather rude, however. I was waiting in my room for some friends when housekeeping knocked to make up the room. I explained that I would be leaving in 10 minutes and would she mind coming back at that time...this did not please the housekeeper at all. She proceeded to glare at me and mumbled something under her breath. Baleen, the hotel restaurant, was OK. It had an ambitious menu that may have been a little beyond its skills and was quite expensive. Room service for breakfast was quite good however. Overall, the hotel was pretty nice. But the town of Daytona Beach really isn't anything to write home about. It looked old and kinda run-down and trashy, and there wasn't a whole lot to do. There was essentially no boardwalk, a few scattered Putt-Putt courses, and a shopping mall. So if you are looking for a nice destination, then this is definitely not the place for you. However, if you are going to be stuck in Daytona Beach anyways, then the Shores is a pretty good place to stay.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cSkip this overpriced looser\u201d", "Author": "Traverl1", "ReviewID": "UR7462443", "Content": "This hotel bosts a multimillion dollar renovation.

We were very impressed with the size and style of the room. The beds were sooooooo comfortable. The hotel reminded me of a boutique. Very stylish and comfortable. The grounds were amazing. Everything was very clean. We hung out at the resort every day. The kids loved the ocean as much as the pool area. We were on the beach one day. Another day it was rainy so the kids hung out in the hot tub, which was pretty much all ours. We got a cabana on our last day and enjoyed the comforts of that as well since the pool area got pretty crowded on Saturday. Of course there are your usual pool chair savers. It was nice not to worry about finding a chair since we had a cabana. Lots of nice people staying and working there. The food and drinks were very good.

They were also unsure about bus/trolley times as well but they did lent me a laptop. The staff were around early to ensure you were well looked after especially round the pool which was heated to bath like temperatures so made a dip at 7.30am in the morning possible even though the weather was a bit cold.

Maybe by the standards of Daytona Beach it's good, but it doesn't rate on any international scale. Fine, I arrived at 2 am but there was no welcome - I had to wander around the lobby trying to find someone and when I did they weren't too pleased to see me! Before I got that far, I had had trouble finding somewhere to park - there was clearly no valet service at that hour but also no indication of where one might park oneself - I found myself in a rather sinister underground carpark, clearly not intended for guests! My room was fine, nothing special but clean and quite acceptable - apart from being on the road side - the constant noise of passing Harley Davidsons, even at 4am, became more than irritating but I recognise that I have the misfortune to have to be here at an unusual period. A minor detail - it would be nice to have tea as well as coffee in the room, and to have all the lights working. I think my less-than-total satisfaction with this place is linked to a number of things: I certainly wouldn't describe the decor as cool, trendy, up-to-the minute or anything of the sort. The public areas are dark and gloomy and the signing is poor. Waiting for elavators takes a lifetime. The gym is worse than one finds in a budget hotel. The staff are superficially friendly but the actual service is pretty standard - that is to say, not great. The restaurant is to my mind disgraceful. I knew the moment I saw that the first member of staff to approach me was toting two blue bottles of designer water that I was in for an exercise in form-over-substance. My soup was a tasteless glue and my main course a piece of over-cooked fish with an over-salted crust, a garnish which was like eating hairs and a combination of two gluey sauces. What I wouldn't have given for a piece of fresh, lightly-grilled fish with some vegetables? What can I say about the absolutely disgusting 'monkey bread'? Over-flavored with thyme and rosemary - herbs that should never be partnered - AND cheese (!) and served with not just olive oil but also balsamic vinegar and black pepper - someone needs to tell the chef less can be more and good food doesn't need this kind of overkill. I wouldn't eat breakfast in the hotel either because one should only provide table serivice - as opposed to buffet - if the service is prompt and efficient - which it isn't. The shop is staffed by a delightful lady but didn't cut it as a hotel shop - no books, magazines, sundries, drinks, cigarettes - nor as a resort boutique - too small, not enough merchandise. All in all I was grateful to find a room at this busy time but wouldn't dream of coming back to stay here except for business, and then only in an ocean-front room. And a last word of warning for anyone under 5ft 19ins - the chairs on the restaurant terrace are so low you will almost have your chin on the table!", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Shores Resort and Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d84333-Reviews-Shores_Resort_and_Spa-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$119 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2637 South Atlantic Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32118</span></span> (Formerly Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84333", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/aa/78/b5/exterior.jpg"}}
