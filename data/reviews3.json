Arriving late at night I notice the parking lot was FULL. I mean, my car could only move in one direction as the cars were too close to one another. They may have had a group staying in the hotel that night. The check-in clerk was nice and showed me where to park (in between two handicap spaces that said 'NO PARKING'). I was worried I would get a ticket but the clerk said it's only for one night. The room was nice. It had all the basic necessities one needs. I like how there were a lot of TV stations and the Internet connection was fast. Early in the morning I went down to get breakfast and the room was very small. Food selection was ok but opted to eat at a restaurant that served breakfast. I toured L.A. for the day and upon my return to the room it was clean. HOWEVER, I realized the cleaning staff took all my soap away and forgot to replace them. So at 10 p.m., I went downstairs to the lobby and asked for soap. I got a facial soap (as that's what was left). I had to use this small facial soap in taking a shower. Anyway, I gave this place a Very Good rating because the room was overall comfortable, the price was reasonable, and it was close to the freeway (to get to where I want). What I didn't like was the parking, breakfast, and the fact they forgot to put soap in my room. I'd still stay here if money is tight or I want to save. By the way, if you plan to use the pool it's very small.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waxahachie, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to crash\u201d", "Author": "lindyhopper63", "ReviewID": "UR116586908", "Content": "Rooms were nice with refrigerator and microwave.

Not only is it well past its prime, but our room was infested with bedbugs. I was attacked by bedbugs, so I called the desk, and showed the night manager the many bugs in my bed as well as my bites and the bloody sheets. She sent us to another room, which was not made up. We finally got a third room and after another shower spent a fitful, basically sleepless night. The bites were severe enough that they required medical attention when I returned home, certainly not what I expected. I understand that bedbugs can infest even the most upscale hotels, but I expect the management to deal with problems quickly and competently. It took many e-mails and unreturned phone calls to the manager to finally get a vouchefr for a free night. This was not satisfactory to me, so I called the Best Western customer relations department and was credited with 20,000 points. I thought the points were in addition to the free night, as I would never have accepted one free night for the pain and inconvenience I suffered. When I tried to use the voucher at a subsequent stay at another Best Western, I learned that the Eagle Rock had cancelled it. So much for taking care of customers. There would have been no amount of money I could have been paid to stay in this hotel had I known I would be eaten alive by bedbugs. I thought the voucher plus the points was barely satisfactory, but by that point I was tired of the weeks of hastle. I guess the Eagle Rock management thinks letting you stay free if you're attacked as I was is enough. If you're willing to be bitten by bedbugs to get a free night (and that only after persistent phone calls and e-mails), the Eagle Rock is the place for you. Otherwise, I suggest you find someplace else. Almost anywhere else would be an improvement.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201cA nice place to stay, but plan for breakfast elsewhere!\u201d", "Author": "jmullins762", "ReviewID": "UR76386256", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here when our price was accepted on Priceline. I was able to upgrade to a King size bed at no additional cost. The room was a bit dated, but had a large flat screen tv, refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The bed was fairly comfortable. The down sides to the room was that there was a huge mirror on one wall, next to the bed. This might be a plus for some, but I didn't appreciate it at all. Another down side was that the air conditioning had to run all night to cool the room down. Suggestion would be to arrive early if you can, and turn it on before you go out for the evening. Breakfast-I have seen reviews that were positive. We did not have that experience. Yes,they had waffles, toaster waffles. not fresh. The breakfast room was very small with minimal seating. There were guests there that took up all the space and I had to reach around them often to get food that I had left on the counter. They ran out of decaf coffee, orange juice and the milk was hidden in the refrigerator. We would have had a more relaxing and enjoyable breakfast somewhere else, but since it was included in the room price, it was okay. Went to IKEA in Burbank later and got a good cup of coffee there before shopping! I would probably stay at this motel again, it was quiet, despite being right next to a freeway, but would probably skip the breakfast. I didn't have a need to use the WiFi so I can't comment on that. .", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities", "Title": "\u201cDecent Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "TravelsOften651", "ReviewID": "UR66271300", "Content": "Overall, this hotel is in a busy area...but it wasn't too bad.
