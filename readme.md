Trivago
=======

Trivago is a hotel comparison website. 
This application allows customers of Trivago to compare hotels for a given topic. 
The comparison uses sentiment analysis on review sentences that mention that topic.

Setup
=====

This setup requires the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) package manager to be installed.

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ source activate trivago-env
```

In windows: ``` activate trivago-env ``` (without the ```source```)

Examples
========

The Trivago app is a command-line application. See usage example below.


**Loading review files and semantic data:**

```
 $ python src/main.py <reviews-dir> <semantics-file>

59 phrases detected
13 intensifiers detected
364 reviews processed for: data/reviews2.json
188 reviews processed for: data/reviews1.json
6748 review sentences analysed in total
5996 words stored in lookup table
```
The semantic file argument is optional, 
by default the semantic file in 'semantics/semantics.json' is loaded.
When no reviews directory is provided, 
the review files in 'data/' are loaded.

Design
============


Implemtation
============

The application is implemented in python 3.


Future Work
============

* Evaluate sentiment analyzer by comparing score 
for topic 'rooms' with rating for rooms (and other rated topics)
* Training sentiment phrase values by using rated topics (as mentioned above)  
* Experiment with other scoring heuristics


* Show top 3 most positive and most negative sentences for each hotel
* More statistics


* Use dictionairy API for synonys and plural/singular forms
* Use translation API for reviews in other languages  

* Inplace update in-memory data structure when new reviews become available
