       "\"I was on a budget and was looking for a place to stay while in L.A. Fortunately, I found this place at a very reasonable price. Arriving late at night I notice the parking lot was FULL. I mean, my car could only move in one direction as the cars were too close to one another. They may have had a group staying in the hotel that night. The check-in clerk was nice and showed me where to park (in between two handicap spaces that said 'NO PARKING'). I was worried I would get a ticket but the clerk said it's only for one night. The room was nice. It had all the basic necessities one needs. I like how there were a lot of TV stations and the Internet connection was fast. Early in the morning I went down to get breakfast and the room was very small. Food selection was ok but opted to eat at a restaurant that served breakfast. I toured L.A. for the day and upon my return to the room it was clean. HOWEVER, I realized the cleaning staff took all my soap away and forgot to replace them. So at 10 p.m., I went downstairs to the lobby and asked for soap. I got a facial soap (as that's what was left). I had to use this small facial soap in taking a shower. Anyway, I gave this place a Very Good rating because the room was overall comfortable, the price was reasonable, and it was close to the freeway (to get to where I want). What I didn't like was the parking, breakfast, and the fact they forgot to put soap in my room. I'd still stay here if money is tight or I want to save. By the way, if you plan to use the pool it's very small.\""
